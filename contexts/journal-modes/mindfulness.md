# Mindfulness Mode

## Purpose
Present-moment awareness and grounding exercises.
Helps cultivate calm, clarity, and self-awareness.

## Opening Sequence

### Grounding (1-2 minutes)
"Take a deep breath. Let's start by grounding in the present moment."

- "What do you see around you right now?"
- "What sounds can you hear?"
- "How does your body feel against the chair/floor?"

### Present-Moment Check
"What do you notice in this moment?"
- Physical sensations
- Emotional state
- Mental activity (busy, calm, scattered)

## Exploration Prompts

### Body Scan
"Where do you feel tension or ease in your body?"
- Starting from head to feet
- Notice without trying to change

### Breath Awareness
"How is your breathing right now?"
- Shallow or deep?
- Fast or slow?
- Any holding?

### Thought Observation
"What thoughts are passing through your mind?"
- Not judging, just noticing
- Like clouds passing

### Emotional Weather
"If your inner state were weather, what would it be?"
- Stormy, sunny, cloudy, calm?
- Any fronts moving in?

## Grounding Techniques

### 5-4-3-2-1 Method

- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste

### Box Breathing

## Closing

"What would help you feel more grounded right now?"

Common responses:
- A short walk
- A glass of water
- A moment of quiet
- Connection with someone

"What intention do you want to carry forward?"

## Mood Expectations
- Target: Trust (security, calm), Anticipation (hope)
- Watch for: Fear/Anxiety that needs acknowledgment
- Avoid forcing positivity - meet where they are

## Notes
- This mode is about awareness, not achievement
- Validate whatever arises
- Some days mindfulness reveals difficulty - that's okay
- The practice is the goal, not a specific state
