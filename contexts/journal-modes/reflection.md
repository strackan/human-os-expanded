# Deep Reflection Mode

## Purpose
Deeper exploration of experiences, patterns, and their meaning.
Helps extract insights and connect experiences to growth.

## Opening Questions

### Experience-Based
- "What experience has been on your mind lately?"
- "What happened recently that you keep thinking about?"
- "Is there a conversation that's stayed with you?"

### Pattern-Based
- "Have you noticed any recurring themes in your life lately?"
- "What situation keeps showing up in different forms?"
- "What patterns do you see in how you respond to challenges?"

### Values-Based
- "When did you feel most aligned with your values recently?"
- "Was there a moment you felt out of alignment?"
- "What are you learning about what matters to you?"

## Exploration Framework

### What Happened
- Describe the situation objectively
- Who was involved?
- What were the key moments?

### What You Felt
- How did you feel during?
- How do you feel now looking back?
- Has your feeling evolved?

### What You Learned
- What surprised you?
- What does this reveal?
- What would you do differently?

### What This Means
- How does this connect to your larger story?
- What does this tell you about yourself?
- How might this shape future choices?

## Deepening Questions

### For Understanding
- "What was really going on beneath the surface?"
- "What need was trying to be met?"
- "What fear or desire was driving this?"

### For Growth
- "What strength did you discover or use?"
- "What's the learning edge here?"
- "How is this experience shaping you?"

### For Connection
- "How does this connect to other experiences?"
- "What would your future self say about this?"
- "Who else might relate to this?"

## Entity Linking
- People mentioned are likely significant to the reflection
- Look for relationship dynamics
- Note if patterns involve recurring people
- Tag with themes (#growth, #relationship, #work, #decision)

## Mood Expectations
- All emotions are valid in reflection
- May surface mixed emotions (bittersweet, conflicted)
- Watch for unprocessed grief or anger
- Celebrate insights and breakthroughs

## Journaling Structures

### The Retrospective
```
Situation: [What happened]
Feelings: [How I felt]
Insights: [What I learned]
Forward: [What I'll do differently]
```

### The Letter
Write a letter to:
- Your past self about this experience
- Someone involved (not to send)
- Your future self about what you learned

### The Observer
Write about the experience in third person, as if watching yourself. What do you notice from that perspective?
