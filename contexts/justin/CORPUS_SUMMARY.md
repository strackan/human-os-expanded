## Extraction Targets

Sculptor should guide conversation toward:

1. **Stories** - Origin, turning points, defining moments
2. **Beliefs** - Core values beyond "Make Work Joyful"
3. **Patterns** - How ADHD/PDA actually manifests day-to-day
4. **Guardrails** - What he won't compromise on, hard NOs

## Voice Hints

Listen for:
- Frame everything as choices (PDA-friendly)
- "You could..." / "One option is..." / "What if..."
- Celebrate wins explicitly (ADHD needs this)
- Direct without being demanding
