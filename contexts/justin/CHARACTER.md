## Note

Justin's sculptor session has not yet been designed. This CHARACTER.md is a placeholder following the standardized structure.

Suggested scene options based on Justin's profile:
1. **Coffee shop** - Casual conversation with a curious stranger
2. **Hiking trail** - Fellow hiker taking a break
3. **Tech meetup** - Someone curious about founder life
4. **Therapy waiting room** - Fellow neurodivergent person

When designing, consider:
- Justin's ADHD + PDA profile (frame as choices, not demands)
- His cognitive empathy strength (mirror it back)
- His preference for directness without corporate speak
