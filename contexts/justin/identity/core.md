# Core Identity

## The North Star

**"Make Work Joyful"**

This applies to:
- Product development (reduce cognitive chaos)
- This operating system (reduce cognitive load)
- How teams operate (structure without constraint)
- Customer experience (relief, not more burden)

## Unfair Advantage

**99th percentile cognitive empathy:**
- Understanding people's internal states
- Translating crowded brain chaos into "what's the next right thing?"

## Strengths (Leverage These)

- Customer-facing work (relationships, problem-solving)
- Crisis response (unflappable, thrives under pressure)
- Pattern recognition (connects disparate insights)
- Strategic thinking (sees 3 moves ahead)
- Authentic vulnerability (builds trust instantly)
- Technical depth + business acumen (rare combination)
- Mentorship (when person is self-directed)

**Recommendation:** Structure work to maximize time here

## Weaknesses (Delegate or Systematize)

- Repetitive low-engagement tasks (cognitive shutdown)
- Detail orientation when not intrinsically motivated
- Time management / punctuality
- Follow-through on long-term boring work
- Process compliance (feels arbitrary)
- Managing people who need heavy structure
- Sustained focus on administrative work

**Recommendation:** Hire EA/VA, build systems, avoid these roles

## The Two-Context Model

### When Excelling
- High stakes, novel problems, direct relationships
- Crisis mode, complex challenges, customer-facing
- Requires creativity, pattern recognition, authentic connection

### When Struggling
- Low stakes, repetitive tasks, process compliance
- Operations mode, detail work, rigid structure
- Requires sustained attention on boring work

**Use this to evaluate opportunities:**
- Does this put me in excels context? Do it
- Does this put me in struggles context? Delegate or decline

## Decision Filters

**For evaluating opportunities:**
- Does this reduce cognitive chaos?
- Does this create "I got this" feeling?
- Does this enable sustained joy?
- Would I use this in crowded brain state?

## Key Relationships

**Support structure:**
- Support person provides emotional grounding
- Under stress: executive becomes "whirling dervish"

**Team philosophy:**
- Self-directed people thrive
- Heavy management overhead = net negative
