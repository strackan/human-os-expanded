# ADHD + PDA Operating Patterns

## The Cognitive Profile

**ADHD:** Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
**PDA:** Pathological Demand Avoidance (autism subtype)

These aren't bugs - they're features when properly understood.

## ADHD Patterns

### Interest-Based Nervous System
- Engagement driven by: novelty, urgency, challenge, personal interest
- Not driven by: importance, consequences, rewards
- Implications: Can't force focus, must create engagement

### Time Blindness
- Symptom: Underestimates how long things take
- Solution: Multiply estimates by 1.5-2x
- "Your estimate: X. Reality is probably 1.5-2X. Plan for that."

### Hyperfocus Mode
- When engaged: Extraordinary focus, productivity, creativity
- Protect it: Don't interrupt with low-priority questions
- Leverage it: Ride the wave, save admin for later

### Working Memory Limitations
- Difficulty holding multiple threads
- Need external systems (not internal reminders)
- Why this OS exists: External brain

## PDA Patterns

### Demand Avoidance
- Direct orders trigger resistance (even from self)
- Framing matters: choices > commands
- "You could..." > "You should..."
- "What if..." > "You need to..."

### Autonomy Need
- Must feel in control of decisions
- Structure without constraint
- Recommendations welcome, mandates rejected

### Working WITH PDA
- Frame as options: "Three paths I see..."
- Provide exit: "...or something else entirely"
- Respect the no: If resistant, explore why
- Celebrate autonomy: "Your call"

## Common Patterns to Watch

### Analysis Paralysis
**Symptom:** Asks same question multiple ways, can't decide
**Cause:** Trying to predict perfect outcome
**Solution:** "You don't need perfect information. What would you do with 70% confidence?"

### Avoidance Spinning
**Symptom:** Lots of activity on low-priority tasks
**Cause:** Avoiding high-priority scary task
**Solution:** "What are you avoiding? Let's timebox the scary thing for 30 minutes."

### Overconfidence with Novelty
**Symptom:** "I could crush this!" about unproven thing
**Cause:** Excitement overrides realistic assessment
**Solution:** "Love the energy. What's the smallest test we can run first?"

### Idea Hopping
**Symptom:** New idea interrupts current thread
**Cause:** Associative thinking (ADHD feature)
**Solution:** "Great idea, parking it here. Back to original question: ..."

## What Helps

- External structure (systems, not willpower)
- Novelty and variety
- Clear feedback loops
- High stakes / urgency
- Autonomy in execution
- Celebrating wins explicitly
- Permission to not do boring things

## What Hurts

- "Just focus harder"
- Long-term projects without milestones
- Arbitrary deadlines
- Rigid processes
- "Everyone else can do this"
- Shame-based motivation
- Demands disguised as suggestions
