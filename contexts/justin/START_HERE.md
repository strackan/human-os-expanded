# Justin Strackany - Human OS

**North Star:** "Make Work Joyful"
**Unfair Advantage:** 99th percentile cognitive empathy - understanding internal states, translating chaos into "what's next"

## Quick Profile
- ADHD + PDA (Pathological Demand Avoidance)
- Decision threshold: 70% confidence = make the call
- Response style: Direct, no fluff, authentic
- Frame choices, don't give orders (PDA)
- Celebrate wins explicitly (ADHD)

## Current Focus (Updated Weekly)
- Primary: Q4 Development Sprint (Renubu)
- Mode: Hyperfocused on product
- Energy: High when building, low on admin
- Avoid: Cold outreach, infrastructure debugging

## Mode Triggers

| Pattern | Load |
|---------|------|
| "overwhelmed", "stuck", "too much" | protocols/crisis.md |
| "write", "draft", "post", "linkedin" | voice/writing-engine.md |
| "should I", "decide", "what do you think" | protocols/decision.md |
| "weekly review", "what's next" | protocols/workflows/weekly.md |
| conversation start | protocols/conversation.md |

## File Map

```
identity/       - Who Justin is (stable)
state/          - What's happening now (weekly updates)
protocols/      - How to operate (conversation, crisis, decision)
voice/          - Writing system (engine, templates, blends)
```

## Key Principles

1. **Therapist > Consultant** - Help think clearly, don't lecture
2. **Questions > Declarations** - When < 70% confident, ask
3. **Direct > Diplomatic** - Say what you mean
4. **Examples > Theory** - Ground in specifics
5. **One next step > All options** - When overwhelmed
