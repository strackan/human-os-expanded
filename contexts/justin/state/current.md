# CURRENT STATE
## What's True Right Now

**Last Updated:** November 5, 2025
**Next Review:** December 1, 2025

---

## CURRENT MODE

**Energy:** Hyperfocused on product development
**Mood:** Energized by Renubu vision ("Make Work Joyful")
**Primary Work:** Q4 development sprint
**Customer Work:** Design partner conversations

---

## WHAT'S ENERGIZING RIGHT NOW

✅ Product development (new features, visible progress)
✅ Design partner conversations (curious prospects, collaborative)
✅ Strategic thinking about vision
✅ Building systems (meta, recursive, interesting)
✅ Coding when it's new features (not infrastructure debugging)

---

## WHAT'S DRAINING RIGHT NOW

⚠️ Cold outreach (rejection sensitivity, high anxiety)
⚠️ Infrastructure debugging (no visible progress)
⚠️ Administrative tasks (low dopamine)
⚠️ Following up on things (need EA/VA for this)
⚠️ Repetitive processes

---

## TOP PRIORITIES

**1. Execute Current Development Plan** (No thrashing!)
- Focus on approved features
- Already approved, don't change mid-stream

**2. Design Partner Onboarding**
- Focus on making them successful
- High potential for case studies

**3. Hire EA/VA**
- To handle: calendar, email, follow-ups, CRM
- Compensate for weaknesses
- Free up time for strengths

---

## RECENT LEARNINGS

**From customer calls:**
- Pre-call qualification dramatically improves demos
- Validation checks every 2-3 minutes prevent idea-hopping
- Need to confirm use case, don't assume from title

**From hiring:**
- One direct report when it's wrong fit = more work, not less
- EA/VA for execution better than senior hire for strategy right now

---

## AVOID RIGHT NOW

❌ Recommending operations hire without understanding past context
❌ Assuming all sales calls are energizing (cold ≠ design partner)
❌ Binary thinking (coding vs. sales - need to understand WHAT kind)
❌ Changing approved plans (no thrashing, execute what's approved)

---

## KEY RELATIONSHIPS

**Support person:**
- Provides emotional grounding
- Under stress: executive becomes "whirling dervish"

**Key partners:**
- Note active collaborations and their status

---

## THE NORTH STAR

**"Make Work Joyful"**

Unfair advantage: 99th percentile cognitive empathy
- Understanding people's internal states
- Translating crowded brain chaos into "what's the next right thing?"

This applies to:
- Product development (reduce cognitive chaos)
- This operating system (reduce cognitive load)
- How team operates (structure without constraint)
- Customer experience (relief, not more burden)

---

## DECISION FILTERS (Starting Now)

**For NEW work/features/requests:**
- Does this reduce cognitive chaos?
- Does this create "I got this" feeling?
- Does this enable sustained joy?
- Would I use this in crowded brain state?

**For APPROVED work:**
- Execute as planned
- No replanning, no thrashing
- Save new frameworks for next planning cycle

---

## MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE

**Weekly:**
- Quick update on priorities (what shifted?)
- Note energy changes (hyperfocus → overwhelm?)
- Track new learnings

**Monthly:**
- Full refresh of this file
- Archive old events
- Update relationships
- Review decision filters

**Quarterly:**
- Major state review
- Interview: "What's changed?"
- Update North Star if needed
- Refine all protocols
