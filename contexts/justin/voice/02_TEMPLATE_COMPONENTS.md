# TEMPLATE COMPONENTS
## The Modular Toolkit for Writing Voice

**Think of these as LEGO blocks. Mix and match.**

---

## OPENINGS (Pick One)

### O1: VULNERABILITY
Start with personal moment of uncertainty/failure/fear
"I was sitting in my car in the Whole Foods parking lot, having just been laid off..."
**Use for:** Product launches, founder updates, authentic connection
**Energy match:** Melancholy, reflective, honest

### O2: ABSURDIST OBSERVATION
Mundane situation → cosmic/existential observation
"You know that feeling at the DMV when time moves differently? Like you've entered a temporal dead zone..."
**Use for:** Event invites, playful content, breaking expectations
**Energy match:** Playful, experimental, contrarian

### O3: SCENE-SETTING
Present tense, vivid sensory details, drop reader into moment
"I'm sitting at Gate C14, watching a guy in a bluetooth headset negotiate what sounds like a hostage situation..."
**Use for:** Travel stories, observations, narrative content
**Energy match:** Observational, storytelling, present

### O4: PATTERN RECOGNITION
"Three things happened this week that seem unrelated..."
**Use for:** Thought leadership, industry commentary, insights
**Energy match:** Philosophical, analytical, connecting-dots

### O5: PROVOCATIVE QUESTION
Challenge assumption immediately
"What if everything you know about customer success is wrong?"
**Use for:** Hot takes, contrarian views, engagement-bait
**Energy match:** Punchy, aggressive, challenging

### O6: SPECIFIC DETAIL
Lead with the weird/interesting/surprising fact
"Chris increased his renewal rate by 47% in 90 days using a strategy that would make most CS leaders uncomfortable..."
**Use for:** Customer stories, case studies, proof points
**Energy match:** Energized, tactical, evidence-driven

---

## MIDDLES (Pick 1-2, Can Combine)

### M1: STORY ARC
Setup → Conflict → Turn → Resolution
Dialogue snippets, action beats, internal monologue
**Use for:** Any narrative content
**Pairs with:** O1, O2, O3

### M2: PHILOSOPHICAL ESCALATION
Start specific → zoom out to pattern → zoom to universal truth
"This isn't really about renewals. It's about..."
**Use for:** Thought leadership, meaning-making
**Pairs with:** O4, O5

### M3: TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE
Show the work, explain the mechanism, prove you understand
**Use for:** Product explanations, how-to, credibility-building
**Pairs with:** O6, O4

### M4: ANALOGY GAME
Take their problem → find parallel from totally different domain
"It's like when you're trying to parallel park..."
**Use for:** Making complex simple, creating "aha" moments
**Pairs with:** Any opener

### M5: LIST-THAT-ISN'T-A-LIST
"Here's what I learned:" → numbered items, BUT each has 2-3 sentences of commentary
**Use for:** Lessons, insights, structured-but-not-boring
**Pairs with:** O1, O4, O6

### M6: DIALOGUE-DRIVEN
Actual conversation, minimal attribution, let dialogue carry the story
**Use for:** Customer stories, real interactions, authenticity
**Pairs with:** O3, O1

### M7: EVIDENCE + VULNERABILITY
Data/metrics PLUS what it felt like, what you were afraid of
"The numbers say X. But what they don't show is..."
**Use for:** Investor updates, credibility + humanity
**Pairs with:** O6, O1

---

## ENDINGS (Pick One)

### E1: OPEN QUESTION
Genuine curiosity, not rhetorical
"Does this resonate? Am I the only one?"
**Use for:** Engagement, community-building, vulnerability
**Pairs with:** Most combinations

### E2: INVITATION
Explicit call to connect/share/join
"If this sounds familiar, let's talk."
**Use for:** Networking, recruiting, event promotion
**Pairs with:** O1, O2, M1, M6

### E3: CALLBACK
Circle back to opening image/question with new meaning
**Use for:** Satisfying structure, literary feel, polish
**Pairs with:** O2, O3, O4

### E4: UNEXPECTED TWIST
Subvert expectations established in opening
**Use for:** Humor, surprise, memorable endings
**Pairs with:** O2, O5, M4

### E5: PRACTICAL APPLICATION
"Here's what to do about it:"
**Use for:** Actionable advice, how-to, utility
**Pairs with:** O4, O5, M3, M5

### E6: PHILOSOPHICAL BUTTON
Micro→macro, specific story→universal truth
**Use for:** Meaning-making, elevation, inspiration
**Pairs with:** O1, O3, M2, M6

## TRANSITIONS (Glue Between Sections)

### T1: THE PIVOT
"But here's the thing..."
"What I didn't expect was..."
"And then it hit me:"

### T2: THE ZOOM
"Zoom out for a second."
"Let's get specific."
"Here's what that actually looks like:"

### T3: THE PARENTHETICAL
"(Quick tangent: ...)"
"(This matters because...)"
"(Stay with me here)"

### T4: THE TIME JUMP
"Fast forward 6 months."
"Back to that moment in the parking lot."
"Which brings us to today."

---

## FLAVOR ELEMENTS (Sprinkle Throughout)

### F1: SELF-DEPRECATION
Genuine, not false modesty
"I was, as my therapist would say, 'catastrophizing'"

### F2: POP CULTURE REFERENCE
Accessible, not obscure
"Like the dog in 'Up' - SQUIRREL!"

### F3: PARENTHETICAL ASIDE
Signature move
"(the worst, am I right?)"
"(I know, I know)"

### F4: VOCABULARY WHIPLASH
High register → low register in same sentence
"The ontological implications are, frankly, fucking wild"

### F5: PROFANITY FOR RHYTHM
Strategic, not gratuitous
"And that's when shit got interesting"

### F6: SPECIFIC EMBARRASSING DETAIL
Makes it real and relatable
"I was wearing the same shirt I'd worn the day before"

### F7: ABSURDIST RABBIT HOLE (Signature Move)
Gateway word → shocking/darkly funny/itchy tangent → callback

**The Test:** Does it make you go "WAIT WHAT?" or "I HAD NO IDEA"?
- Shocking detail that rewrites the story
- Darkly funny irony that hits a core anxiety
- Completely unexpected connection
- Historical wtf moment

**Structure:**
- Use gateway word as launch pad
- Commit fully -- go 200-300 words if the story earns it
- Must have bite: ironic, dark, or "that can't be real"
- End with callback to main point

### F8: SPACING AS PACING (Beat Poetry)
Visual rhythm on the page. Spacing = conversational beats.

**Double space (paragraph break):**
= Pause in conversation
= Breathing room between thoughts

**Single line breaks (within section):**
= Rapid fire
= List energy but funnier/more chaotic

**Long paragraph:**
= Intentional signal: "settle in, story time"
= But STILL break every ~100 words for relief

### F9: THE VULNERABILITY BOUNDARY
Allude to the mess, don't be IN the mess

**YES:** Past tense reference to hard shit
**NO:** Present tense weakness

### F10: THE TRICKSTER (Andy Kaufman Energy)
Subverting reader expectations -- but only sometimes

**Critical:** Don't ALWAYS pull the rug
When you let emotion land without the joke = hits harder
The uncertainty makes both moves more powerful
