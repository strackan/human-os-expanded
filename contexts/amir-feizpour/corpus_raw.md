## About

Not sure how to get from "AI hype" to a working LLM agent in production?
Frustrated with prototypes that never make it past the demo stage?
Looking for a faster way to launch a reliable MVP?

I've been in your position—and I've seen companies of all sizes hit the same roadblocks: from my days at a large corporate, all the way to my own startup, and now helping 10s of businesses and their tech teams navigate the rapid waters of LLM applications.

- MVPs fail in production because reliability breaks down
- Business leaders can't connect demos to ROI
- Teams don't have the experience to adapt agentic AI to real workflows
- Great product ideas stall before they reach market

There's a better way to build and deploy agentic AI—one that works in the real world.

---

We help founders, product teams, and companies put agentic AI to work through:

- **LLM Agents Bootcamp** → Hands-on program to build a reliable MVP fast (founders, devs, product managers)
- **Corporate Training** → Customized version of the bootcamp for your company's use cases
- **Advisory** → Fractional Chief AI Officer support for SMBs and startups
- **Implementation** → End-to-end builds for agentic workflow automation and other AI products
- **Product Incubation** → Partnership with traditional businesses to launch new agentic products

Book me to talk: https://calendly.com/amirfzpr/

Work with us and you will:
- Launch an MVP in weeks, not months
- Ship solutions that perform under real-world conditions
- Unlock new revenue with agent-powered workflows
- Equip your team for long-term success with agentic AI

## Selected LinkedIn Posts

### On AI Agents Series & Community (1mo ago)
> This week is the first time we don't have an "AI Agents Series" session on Friday in months! I thought that's a good moment to reflect on all the great sessions we had, all the learnings we shared, and all the connections we facilitated. This is a great opportunity to thank my unsung heros, all our speakers for this year...

### On Holiday Bootcamp (1mo ago)
> so I thought the holidays, self-paced bootcamp (for building llm agent apps) would be a wild card but the response has been great...

### On Bootcamp Demo (1mo ago)
> Public demo of our bootcamp is coming up this Friday!
> - Easeya - agentic data pipeline for CSRD disclosures
> - AI_PM OS - for Product Managers drowning in meetings
> - Coily Compass - helps travelers with textured hair find personalized product recommendations
> - Research2Market (R2M) - GenAI-powered multi-agent system analyzing 200M+ research papers
> - CWYT - Conversations With Your Thoughts
> - MediAssist - helps hospitals prevent billing crises
> - Zaal - AI-powered educational depth assessment tool

### On AI Adoption in Professional Services (2mo ago)
> How do I balance organizational adoption of AI and doing so safely? Every partner I talk to at professional services firms is wrestling with this. Some staff are over-eager, some are dragging their feet. The tension: they charge a premium for the white glove, human touch experience and AI adoption shouldn't damage that.

> Here's the pattern I'm seeing: the firms making progress aren't the ones with elaborate roadmaps. They're the ones who created a small, low-risk experiment that made change feel safer than staying put.

### On AI Evaluation (2mo ago)
> Your junior analyst gets something wrong, you review their reasoning, coach them, they do better next time. Your AI agent gets something wrong, you check its "coherence" and "groundedness" or at best F1 score, and push to production without noticing. See the problem?

> This is why AI projects are dying between prototype and production in businesses. We're evaluating agents that need to exercise judgment using metrics designed for classification tasks...

### On Identity & Career Crossroads (3mo ago)
> Meet Neil Bartlett, my unsung hero, the SVP who gave me permission to not choose. Less than 12 months into my industry job, I got offered to manage a small team. I asked if I could do both - stay hands-on IC and manage...

> He said: "The fact that you're this torn means you think you can be good at both. If I were you, I'd choose management; that scales the impact you want to have. But here's the flip side: you have to make damn sure you don't lose your technical ability outside of 9-5."

> He was the first person who introduced me to the idea of identity diversification, even though I wouldn't name it that for years.

### On Lone Wolf vs Community Builder (3mo ago)
> I've always been driven by building communities and creating social spaces. It's a core part of who I am. But a recent leadership workshop threw me a curveball. A questionnaire identified me as a "lone wolf" archetype, meaning my default stress response is to withdraw and solve problems by myself.

> At first, I disagreed. How can I be a community builder and a lone wolf? But the more I think about it, the more I see the tension in myself. The pull to connect with others, and the instinct to retreat when things get tough.

> Maybe the "lone wolf" is a fight-or-flight response, a survival mechanism. And the community builder is the actualized state, the person I am when I feel safe and supported.

### On Vibe Coding (3mo ago)
> 2025: "Just vibe code, it should magically work"
> 2015: "Just use the SaaS, it should magically work"
> 2005: "Just use the library, it should magically work"
>
> The technology changes. The wishful thinking doesn't.

### On Demo vs Production Gap (3mo ago)
> It is much more likely for your project to be stuck at the demo status because of mindset than technical capability. With Claude/Replit/Cursor etc, vibe-coding your way to a working prototype is not the hard problem.

> The gap between "this works when I run it" and "paying customers rely on this daily" is about answering questions most builders skip:
> - Should I even build this? (beyond "omg, I can build this")
> - How do I know it's working? (beyond "it feels right")
> - Can it recover from / handle engineering failures AND the stochastic nature of LLMs?

### On Product Managers & AI (4mo ago)
> Is AI making Product Managers obsolete? For a while, I even wondered if it might be true... But the more we build AI systems and train people to do that, the more I believe the opposite is true. The PM role isn't disappearing; it's becoming more critical than ever.

> Why? Because we're moving from a world of deterministic software to a world of stochastic systems... And in this new world, the PM's job shifts from managing a backlog to becoming a "Guardian of Uncertainty."

### On Startup Advice (4mo ago)
> The worst startup advice I ever followed: "Fake it till you make it."

> Early in my startup career, I spent months perfecting features that no one had asked for. Why? Because talking to potential customers felt... uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, I had done a few that fed my confirmation bias and then had stopped!

### On Energy Management (4mo ago)
> "Just manage your time better" But honestly? For me, the real bottleneck isn't the clock, it's energy. If I'm drained or stuck in a bad headspace, all the time in the world won't make me productive or a better decision-maker.

> What's helped me is paying attention to how I reset my emotional state. And I think of it in two buckets:
> - Bottom-Up (Body → Mind): Deep breathing, quick walk, cold water on face
> - Top-Down (Mind → Body): Journaling, reframing conflicts, talking myself back into focus

### On Agent Frameworks (5mo ago)
> which agent framework should i use? this is a question that I've really struggled answering over the past 2 years. the reason for my struggle is that their differences are marginal and the majority of the work is really in the experimental discovery of what's needed for your use case.

> now you can use frameworks and make no progress, or you can throw together your own structure and make a lot of progress. what makes the difference is your ability / mindset / experience in experimentally discovering the right solutions for your problem. not the agent framework, not the model, none of that

### On GPT5 (5mo ago)
> GPT5 is out and half the people are losing their minds and half are pooping on it! and probably both are right. what I think all the above are missing though is that the size of the number in front of your GPT doesn't matter; what matters is how you use it...it's all about system design and putting the right things in the right places, my friends

### On Intermittent Fasting (5mo ago)
> I haven't posted about health stuff in so long! I have been doing intermittent fasting on and off for a few years now... solution: this time I decided that instead of focusing too much on 18 hours a day, I'm going to aim for 120 hours in the past 7 days, moving window!

> impact: gamification, baby! now, if I miss a day or two, I try to make up for it in the following days instead of feeling guilty and eating my guilt

### On Agentic Systems Complexity (6mo ago)
> agentic systems are some of the most sophisticated software systems we have built as a species and yet I am always baffled when people show up to our bootcamp... and act like "I thought this was supposed to be easy"

> ...there's this illusion of "I'll take care of the surface and delegate managing the complexity completely to the model / agentic framework / no-code tool ... provider" (which is a bad thing)

> you no longer need to be an engineer to launch a software business but you cannot skip the rigorous engineering mindset of problem solving on your way to success!

### On Identity Diversification (7mo ago)
> "what would you do if money wouldn't be a constraint at all". This is one of my favorite questions to ask people. They give different answers. But deep down everyone is saying, one way or another, "I would want to do what I love, with people I love".

> ...The role of identity diversification and fluidity is quite interesting. Imagine if you weren't so rigidly the "corporate guy" or the "VC-backed founder" or the "bootstrapped entrepreneur". And instead you were 60% "financially responsible corporate guy", 30% "bootstrapped clean-tech entrepreneur", and 10% the social butterfly.

### On Teaching at Waterloo (7mo ago)
> today I'm starting to teach "foundations of large language models" at University of Waterloo as a seasonal instructor.
> (271 reactions, 28 comments)

### On MaRS Advisory Role
> So, since I already spend quite a bit of time talking to founders about startup life and AI stuff, I figured I should formalize it and expand my reach... I'll be working with MaRS Discovery District as a volunteer AI advisor helping their portfolio companies navigate the landscape of AI opportunities.
> (531 reactions, 62 comments)

### On Conflict at Work
> I'm curious how people handle conflict at work. if you have an elaborate ritual please share it as a comment

### On Social Media Usage
> do you spend too much time on social media? here is the trick I have used to reduce mine: _add friction_
> - remove the app from your phone
> - open, post and leave on laptop
> - decide who your few dozen people are, text them, call them
