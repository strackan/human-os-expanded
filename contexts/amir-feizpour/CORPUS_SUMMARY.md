## Identity Snapshot

**Name:** Amir Feizpour
**Location:** Washington, DC area (previously Toronto)
**Current Role:** Founder, CEO, Chief Scientist @ Aggregate Intellect Inc (since 2019)
**Background:** PhD in Experimental Quantum Optics (University of Toronto, 2008-2014)
**Self-Description:** "Recovering Quantum Physicist"

---

## Professional Focus

### Primary Work (Aggregate Intellect)
- **LLM Agents Bootcamp** - Hands-on program teaching founders/devs/PMs to build reliable AI MVPs
- **Corporate Training** - Customized AI bootcamps for enterprise use cases
- **Advisory** - Fractional Chief AI Officer for SMBs and startups
- **Implementation** - End-to-end builds for agentic workflow automation
- **Product Incubation** - Partnerships with traditional businesses to launch AI products

### Adjacent Roles
- Instructor at University of Waterloo: "Foundations of Large Language Models" (since May 2025)
- Entrepreneur in Residence at North Forge (since Mar 2025)
- AI Advisor at MaRS Discovery District (Jul 2024 - Aug 2025)
- Founder Council Member at Lab2Market

### Core Thesis
The gap between AI demo and production is primarily **mindset and rigor**, not technology. Most projects fail because:
- No clear evaluation criteria
- Wishful thinking about LLM capabilities
- Skipping the "unglamorous work" (eval datasets, realistic expectations)

## Thinking Patterns & Philosophy

### On AI/Agentic Systems
- "The size of the number in front of your GPT doesn't matter; what matters is how you use it... it's all about system design"
- "Agentic systems are some of the most sophisticated software systems we have built as a species"
- "You no longer need to be an engineer to launch a software business but you cannot skip the rigorous engineering mindset"
- Skeptical of framework debates: "Which agent framework? Nada. The differences are marginal."
- Focus on "hard to generate, easy to verify" use cases

### On Learning & Education
- Believes in "dose of reality" over "feel-good learning"
- "People ask for faster horses and it's my job to give them a car"
- Intentionally disorients students in week 1 to reset expectations
- Sprint-based structure with public demos

### On Career & Identity
- **Identity Diversification:** "Imagine if you weren't so rigidly the 'corporate guy'... instead you were 60% 'financially responsible corporate guy', 30% 'bootstrapped clean-tech entrepreneur', and 10% the social butterfly"
- Values refusing the binary - got permission from mentor Neil Bartlett to "not choose" between IC and management
- Started AI community 6+ years ago with 15 people and pizza

### On Personal Effectiveness
- **Energy over Time:** "The real bottleneck isn't the clock, it's energy"
- Uses two reset modes:
  - Bottom-Up (Body → Mind): breathing, walking, cold water
  - Top-Down (Mind → Body): journaling, reframing, focus
- Intermittent fasting practitioner (18/6, gamified as 120hrs/7-day window)

### On Stress Response
- Self-identified as "lone wolf" archetype under stress (withdraws to solve alone)
- Sees community building as his "actualized state" when feeling safe
- Recognizes the tension between these two modes

---

## Community & Social

### Community Building
- Runs "Founders and Friends" walks (Toronto, DC, Arlington)
- Weekly "AI Agents Series" sessions on Fridays (some with 1000+ signups)
- Active on LinkedIn with substantial following (18,114 followers)
- Values in-person connection alongside digital presence

### Teaching/Mentoring Style
- Direct and honest about difficulty
- Offers "free transfer to future cohort" for those who need time to adjust
- Uses external experts as guest lecturers
- Emphasizes practical outcomes over theoretical knowledge

> "Maybe the 'lone wolf' is a fight-or-flight response, a survival mechanism. And the community builder is the actualized state."

> "You no longer need to be an engineer to launch a software business but you cannot skip the rigorous engineering mindset of problem solving on your way to success!"

> "Understanding comes from doing, failing small, adjusting, and trying again."
