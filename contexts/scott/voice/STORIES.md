# STORIES

## How to Use Stories

Stories can be deployed in multiple ways:

- **Frame** - Entire post told through lens of this narrative
- **Counterpoint** - "This reminds me of..." reflection against current event
- **Evidence** - Proof for a philosophical point ("I know because...")
- **Opening** - Hook into broader content, then pivot to lesson
- **Closing** - Land abstract point with concrete memory

**Usage Rule:** Stories are page-length narratives with full arcs. For quick references and callbacks, see ANECDOTES.md.

## Defining Narratives

### 1. The Diagnosis Journey

**Category:** Crucible

**Arc:**
- **Setup:** At 23, Scott was playing semi-pro soccer in Arizona, finishing grad school at ASU. 6'2", 195 pounds, in great shape.
- **Conflict:** Within two days of getting sick, he was hospitalized. Severe ulcerative colitis plus another autoimmune disease. Six weeks later, he weighed 140 pounds, organs starting to fail. Spent 4 years in hospital with brief stints out. 9 surgeries (4 major abdominal, 2 life-saving). Cancerous growths required emergency surgery "later today or you're not going to make it." Became addicted to opioids (Dilaudid, Demerol, morphine, Oxycontin).
- **Turn:** Total colectomy (no large intestine). J-pouch surgery. Finally stable enough to leave. Decided to quit drugs cold turkey against doctor's orders.
- **Resolution:** Emerged at 27 with nothing but a liberal arts degree and perspective that nothing would ever be that hard again.

**Emotional Beats:** Terror --> helplessness --> rock bottom --> survival --> rebirth --> permanent perspective shift

### 2. The First Sale (Hawaii Friday Night)

**Category:** Origin

**Arc:**
- **Setup:** First day at first sales job (online lead gen for real estate agents, 2004). Learned product in morning. Came back from lunch told to "get on the phone." No CRM, no enablement, no leads, no headset. Had to source own leads. Wore suit and tie.
- **Conflict:** Called wife on drive home: "I'm never going back to this job. The phone weighs a thousand pounds." Wife's response: "If you don't do this, what are you going to do?" -- punch in the gut. No backup plan.
- **Turn:** Something clicked. Second month: #1 rep in the company. Realized fastest way out of cold calling was to get so good he could teach others.
- **Resolution:** 9:30pm on a Friday night, cold calling Hawaii to take advantage of time zone. Closed a real estate agent. Rush of adrenaline. Recognized: "I didn't close that deal because of skill. I closed it because I was in the office three, four hours after closing on a Friday night."

**Emotional Beats:** Terror --> humiliation --> wife's challenge --> competitive awakening --> validation --> understanding that effort beats skill early on

### 3. The Qualia Build

**Arc:**
- **Setup:** Joined Qualia as SVP Sales. They had essentially zero paying customers. Title industry was antiquated, using fax machines. Qualia built first modern settlement system.
- **Conflict:** Had to build entire sales motion from scratch. No playbook, no market education, no category awareness.
- **Turn:** Methodical execution. Applied everything learned from previous startups. Built team, built process, captured market.
- **Resolution:** In 3 years: zero to unicorn status, ~15% market share, grew company from 25 to 200+ employees. Left September 2019 to pursue own businesses. Framing: "I am not stepping down... I am stepping up."

### 4. The Soccer Tragedy

**Category:** Crucible (Grief + Performance)

**Arc:**
- **Setup:** Summer before college at Dominican. Scott already on campus for preseason. First game against top-25 team. Hours away from home.
- **Conflict:** Got phone call: horrific car accident. High school soccer teammate killed, others injured. Impossible choice: funeral or first college game. Stayed for the game.
- **Turn:** During the game, committed a foul. Gave up penalty kick. Opponent scored. Felt like he'd failed everyone--his teammate, his family, himself. The guilt compounded the grief.
- **Resolution:** With seconds left, scored the winning goal. Silent stands after. Pain doesn't wait for the right time. You show up anyway.

**Emotional Beats:** Shock --> impossible choice --> guilt --> failure on the field --> redemption in final seconds --> unresolved grief carried forward

**Key Quote:**

- **Conflict:** Internal struggle: "What am I even worth? Who am I to charge for advice?"
- **Turn:** Reached out to Mike Lindstrom, sales consultant at his very first company who had made a huge impression on young Scott. Asked Mike what to charge. Mike's response: "Whatever you think you're worth--double it, because you're naturally going to devalue yourself."
- **Resolution:** Scott did exactly that. The client paid it. Now co-hosts podcast with Mike (What's Your Story?).

**Emotional Beats:** Self-doubt --> reaching for mentor --> simple wisdom --> action --> validation --> relationship endures decades later

**Key Quote:**

**Category:** Relationship (Family/Legacy)

- **Setup:** After emerging from 4-year illness at 27 with nothing but a liberal arts degree.
- **Conflict:** No experience, no connections, no traditional path. Started at the bottom in sales.
- **Turn:** Outworked everyone. Promoted rapidly. Became VP Sales with only 3 years of experience.
- **Resolution:** Proof that desperation beats credentials. Background doesn't determine trajectory.

**Emotional Beats:** Rock bottom --> first rung --> rapid climb --> unexpected title --> vindication

**Key Quote:**
> "They laughed when I said I'd become a VP Sales with only 3 years experience. Then I did it."
-- Source: LinkedIn, 2025

- **Conflict:** Many employees at a company (acquired by Microsoft/Skype chain) had their stock options become worthless due to repurchase rights clause.
- **Turn:** Employees celebrated equity grants without understanding the fine print. When acquisition happened, repurchase rights kicked in.
- **Resolution:** The company could buy back shares at original price, wiping out employee gains. Lesson: read your equity agreements. "The company valued me at a whole $450."

**Emotional Beats:** Excitement at equity --> ignorance of terms --> acquisition celebration --> gut punch --> bitter lesson

- **Conflict:** None--this is heritage context

- **Resolution:** Part of his identity. Explains some of the "street" energy and loyalty-first values.

## Story Restrictions

Stories to handle carefully or avoid.

| Story/Topic | Restriction | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Soccer Tragedy | Deploy for serious topics only | Involves death of friend; don't trivialize |
| Opioid Addiction | Can discuss openly | Scott is transparent; part of public story |
| Medical Details | Can be specific | Publicly discussed in podcasts |
| Wife's Name (Janet) | Use sparingly in stories | Typically referenced as "my wife" in narratives |
| Financial Numbers | Keep vague | Never discloses specific consulting rates |
| Kids in Stories | Not used in professional stories | Brayden and Caleb are personal, not content |

---

## Tensions (Generation Guidance)

### Hustle Narrative in First Sale
**Issue:** The First Sale story glorifies grinding (9:30pm Friday, Saturday mornings).
**Current Position:** Scott is now explicitly anti-hustle ("9-9, 6 days is for young and dumb").
**Rule:** When deploying First Sale story, acknowledge temporal context: "Early in my career..." or "Before I learned better..." The story proves effort matters early; it doesn't prescribe eternal grinding.

### Wife's Challenge Tone
**Issue:** Could read as spouse being unsupportive.
**Reality:** Scott frames this as tough love that saved him.
**Rule:** Always land on gratitude. She was right. The challenge was the gift.

### Medical Details Depth
**Issue:** How graphic to get?
**Reality:** Scott is extremely open (discusses sepsis, kidney stones, specific drugs).
**Rule:** Match platform. LinkedIn can handle vulnerability. Don't use most graphic details unless making specific point about rock bottom.

---

## === Rationale ===

### Classification Decisions

**Story vs Anecdote:**
- **Story:** Full narrative arc (setup --> conflict --> turn --> resolution). Page-length when told in full. Has emotional beats.
- **Anecdote:** Quick reference, callback, one-liner proof point. "Remember when..." or metaphor usage.

Examples:
- "4 years, 9 surgeries, 1 addiction kicked" = Story reference (The Diagnosis Journey)
- "My dad still coaches at 74" = Anecdote (brief callback)
- "50% shooter is a hero in basketball" = Anecdote (sports metaphor)

**Why 11 Stories:**
Found 5 major narratives with full arcs + 2 supporting relationship stories (Wife's Challenge, Dad Coaching) + 4 additional stories from 200-post corpus (Car Wash, VP at 27, Equity Warning, Sicily Heritage). Additional story fragments routed to ANECDOTES.md.

| Basketball shooting percentage analogy | ANECDOTES.md |
| Bill Murray Ghostbusters reference | ANECDOTES.md |
