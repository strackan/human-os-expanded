## 50/50 Calls Made

### 1. Wife's Challenge: Separate Story or Part of First Sale?
**Decision:** Documented as both--separate entry AND part of First Sale
**Rationale:** The Wife's Challenge is emotionally distinct (relationship story about tough love) but narratively linked to First Sale origin. Keeping both allows flexibility in deployment.
**Confidence:** High

### 2. Dad Coaching: Story or Anecdote?
**Decision:** Included as Story (brief, but with clear arc)
**Rationale:** It has setup (professor, college soccer player), resolution (still coaching at 74), and emotional payload (legacy, longevity). Though brief, it functions as a story Scott deploys.
**Confidence:** Medium-High

### 3. Soccer Tragedy: Include or Handle Separately?
**Decision:** Included with careful restrictions
**Rationale:** It's a defining narrative he's chosen to share publicly (Oct 2025 LinkedIn). The restriction guidance ensures appropriate deployment.
**Confidence:** High

### 4. "Bob" Ramping Story: Story or Anecdote?
**Decision:** Routed to ANECDOTES.md
**Rationale:** Brief illustration of ramping concept, not a full narrative arc. Better suited as teaching anecdote than defining story.
**Confidence:** High

### 5. How Many Stories to Include?
**Decision:** 7 stories (5 major + 2 supporting relationship stories)
**Rationale:** Captured all narratives with full arcs. Briefer references (surfing metaphors, sports analogies) routed to ANECDOTES.md.
**Confidence:** High

### 6. Medical Detail Level: How Graphic?
**Decision:** Include full details available in public corpus
**Rationale:** Scott is extremely transparent in Revenue.io podcast (sepsis, specific drugs, levitating hallucinations). These details are public and intentional.
**Confidence:** High

## === Open Questions for Sculptor ===

### Story Accuracy

1. **Diagnosis Timeline**
   We captured "4 years in hospital" with brief stints out. Is this the right framing, or should it be "4 years dealing with illness" (with significant hospital time)?

2. **Soccer Tragedy Details**
   We have limited details on this story (Oct 2025 LinkedIn post). Are there additional beats or context that should be captured?

3. **Qualia Numbers**
   We cite "~15% market share" and "25 to 200+ employees." Are these accurate, or should they be adjusted?

### Missing Stories

4. **Other Career Pivots**
   Are there defining stories from Reply!, Main Street Hub, or OutboundEngine that deserve full Story treatment (not just anecdote)?

5. **Surf and Sales Origin**
   We don't have a full narrative arc for how Surf and Sales started. Is there a defining story there?

6. **Other Mentors**
   Mike Lindstrom is documented. Are there other mentor relationships with story-worthy moments?

### Story Restrictions

7. **Kids in Content**
   We noted Brayden and Caleb are not used in professional stories. Is this accurate, or are there exceptions?

8. **Soccer Tragedy Deployment**
   We marked this for "serious topics only." Are there specific contexts where this story should definitely NOT be used?

### Usage Guidance

9. **Story Combinations**
   Are there stories that should (or should never) be told together in the same piece of content?

10. **Platform Differences**
    Are there stories reserved for certain platforms (e.g., full Diagnosis for podcasts only, abbreviated for LinkedIn)?

### Tensions Documented

2. **Wife's Challenge Tone** - Land on gratitude, not complaint
3. **Medical Details Depth** - Match platform; LinkedIn can handle vulnerability
