## Queued Items Received

| From | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| VOICE_SUMMARY.md | CTA patterns | Captured as E1-E3 |
| OPENINGS_SUMMARY.md | CTA/ending patterns | Captured as E1-E24 |
| MIDDLES_SUMMARY.md | CTA/ending patterns | Captured as E1-E24 |

| ANECDOTES_SUMMARY.md | How to close with anecdote callback | Captured as E19 (Metaphor Return) with surfing/sports notes |

## Source Prioritization

| Tier | Weight | Sources |
|------|--------|---------|
| Primary | Highest | linkedin-posts-2025-12.md (50 posts, full endings visible) |
| Secondary | High | Voice Analysis Notes in corpus (10 CTA/ending patterns pre-extracted) |
| Tertiary | Medium | VOICE.md v1.1, OPENINGS.md v1.1, MIDDLES.md v1.0 (consistency checks) |
| Reference | Lowest | DIGEST.md (pattern validation) |

## 50/50 Calls Made

### 1. How Many Ending Categories?
**Decision:** 7 categories (CTA, Wisdom, Prescription, Challenge, Callback, Question, Service)
**Rationale:** These represent functionally different closing intentions. Wisdom closes land insight; Challenge closes confront; Callback closes create loop. Each serves different content goals.
**Confidence:** High

### 2. Stop/Start: Voice Pattern or Ending Pattern?
**Decision:** Both - documented in VOICE.md as rhythm pattern, in ENDINGS.md as E10
**Rationale:** "Stop X. Start Y." is a sentence-level voice mechanic AND a distinct ending pattern. The structure appears throughout posts (voice), but when used in final position it has closing function (ending).
**Confidence:** High

### 3. Pithy Summary: Too Broad?
**Decision:** Keep as single pattern (E4) despite variety
**Rationale:** All one-liner wisdom closes share the same function: crystallize the takeaway. The content varies but the pattern is consistent.
**Confidence:** High

### 4. "Do Your Thing LinkedIn": Standalone or Combined?
**Decision:** Standalone (E2) but noted as often combined with E1
**Rationale:** Functions independently as community invocation, but frequently follows E1 (Direct Referral). Worth tracking separately.
**Confidence:** Medium-High

### 5. CTA Frequency Guidance?
**Decision:** Added tension noting CTAs should be rare
**Rationale:** Most posts end with wisdom or challenge, not CTA. CTAs appear primarily in explicit promotion posts (job listings, events).
**Confidence:** High

### 6. Ending Combinations: Include or Route to BLENDS.md?
**Decision:** Include brief section in ENDINGS.md, full treatment in BLENDS.md
**Rationale:** Showing combinations helps understand how endings layer. Full Open+Middle+End archetypes belong in BLENDS.md.
**Confidence:** High

## === Open Questions for Sculptor ===

### Pattern Validation

1. **E4 (Pithy Summary) Variety**
   We captured all one-liner wisdom closes as E4. Are there subcategories worth distinguishing (reframe vs. metaphor vs. prescription)?

2. **E10 (Stop/Start) Signature Status**
   This appears to be Scott's most distinctive ending. Is it conscious signature or natural pattern?

3. **E6 (Math Close) Frequency**
   "That's not philosophy. That's math." appears 3+ times. Is this intentional repetition for brand reinforcement?

### Missing Endings

4. **Newsletter Endings**
   LinkedIn endings captured extensively. Are there newsletter-specific closing patterns we missed?

5. **Podcast Closings**
   How does Scott end podcast segments? Different patterns for audio?

6. **Thread Endings**
   For multi-post threads/carousels, are there specific closing patterns?

### CTA Effectiveness

7. **CTA Engagement Data**
   Which CTA types drive most engagement? Is E22 (Engagement Question) actually effective?

8. **E2 (Do Your Thing LinkedIn) Performance**
   Does this community invocation actually increase shares/comments?

### Pairing Guidance

9. **Ending Mismatches**
   Are there opening/middle + ending combinations that feel wrong? Examples to avoid?

10. **Length Matching**
    Does ending length need to match post length? Can long posts end with single-line E4?

### Platform Considerations

11. **LinkedIn vs. Other Platforms**
    Do ending patterns change for Instagram, newsletter, or other channels?

12. **Emoji in Endings**
    We noted Scott rarely uses emoji. Are endings ever an exception?

## Integration Notes

### Cross-References Created

- E4 (Pithy Summary) --> VOICE.md "Pithy Summary Lines to Close"
- E10 (Stop/Start Pair) --> VOICE.md "Stop/Start Prescription Pairs"
- E19 (Metaphor Return) --> ANECDOTES.md Surfing System
- E20 (Story Callback) --> STORIES.md (various)
- E6 (Math Close) --> VOICE.md "That's not philosophy. That's math." signature phrase

### Pattern Distribution (from 50 posts)

| Pattern | Count | % of Posts |
|---------|-------|------------|
| E4 (Pithy Summary) | 10+ | 20%+ |
| E10 (Stop/Start) | 5+ | 10%+ |
| E19 (Metaphor Return) | 4+ | 8%+ |
| E20 (Story Callback) | 3+ | 6%+ |
| E1 (Direct Referral) | 3+ | 6%+ |
| E6 (Math Close) | 3+ | 6%+ |
| Standalone (no distinct ending) | 8+ | 16%+ |
| Others | 2-3 each | Varies |

Note: ~16% of posts are standalone pithy content with no distinct "ending" beyond the insight itself.

### Tension Summary

1. **CTA Frequency** - Reserve for explicit promotion posts
2. **Question Close Risk** - Avoid engagement bait, only genuine questions
3. **Stop/Start Overuse** - Vary with alternatives to prevent predictability
4. **Story Callback Requirement** - Only works if opening was story-based
5. **Platform Considerations** - E22 drives LinkedIn comments; adjust for other channels

### New Patterns Discovered

During synthesis, we identified these patterns not in original Voice Analysis Notes:

- **E13 (Make It Work Cascade):** Stacked imperatives building to action
- **E16 (Maybe It's You):** Confrontational flip of responsibility
- **E17 (Conditional Warning):** If/then structure exposing non-answer as answer
- **E24 (Service Tagline):** "We do X so you don't have to" event branding

These were added because they appeared 2+ times and serve distinct closing purposes.
