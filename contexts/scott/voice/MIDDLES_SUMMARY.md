## Queued Items Received

| From | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| VOICE_SUMMARY.md | Content archetypes (how voice applies to structures) | Captured as foundation for middle structures |
| OPENINGS_SUMMARY.md | Middle structure patterns | Captured as M1-M16 |
| OPENINGS_SUMMARY.md | How openings combine with middles/endings | Captured in Energy Matching Guide |

## Source Prioritization

| Tier | Weight | Sources |
|------|--------|---------|
| Primary | Highest | linkedin-posts-2025-12.md (50 posts, full structures visible) |
| Secondary | High | VOICE.md v1.1 (rhythm patterns applied to middles) |
| Tertiary | Medium | OPENINGS.md v1.1 (opening types for matching) |
| Reference | Lowest | DIGEST.md (pattern validation) |

## 50/50 Calls Made

### 1. How Many Argument Structures?
**Decision:** 6 distinct patterns (M1-M6)
**Rationale:** Found clear separation between Contrarian Evidence Stack (stacking proof), Parallel Domain (metaphor-based), Sequential Framework (numbered steps), Pro/Con (balanced analysis), Formula Contrast (before/after), and Insider Reveal (they say/they don't say).
**Confidence:** High

### 2. Narrative vs. Story Structures?
**Decision:** Keep narrative structures in MIDDLES.md (M7-M9), full stories in STORIES.md
**Rationale:** MIDDLES.md covers structural patterns (how to build a story arc in a post). STORIES.md covers specific narratives (Diagnosis Journey, First Sale, etc.) with full beats.
**Confidence:** High

### 3. List Structures: Voice or Middle?
**Decision:** MIDDLES.md for list structures, VOICE.md for sentence rhythm
**Rationale:** List structures (M10-M13) are paragraph-level organization. VOICE.md's "Parallel List Structures" pattern covers sentence-level rhythm within lists.
**Confidence:** High

### 4. Transition Techniques: Separate Category or Part of Structures?
**Decision:** Separate category (T1-T4)
**Rationale:** Transitions are modular--they work between any structures. Embedding them would mean repetition across M1-M16.
**Confidence:** High

### 5. Credential Stack: Evidence or Argument?
**Decision:** Evidence Pattern (M14)
**Rationale:** It's a specific proof technique, not an argument flow. M14 feeds into argument structures (especially M1 and M9) but isn't a complete middle pattern on its own.
**Confidence:** High

### 6. Energy Matching: Prescriptive or Suggestive?
**Decision:** Created guide table, not hard rules
**Rationale:** Opening --> Middle pairing is contextual. Table suggests best matches without being rigid. Added "Avoid" column to flag mismatches.
**Confidence:** High

## === Open Questions for Sculptor ===

### Pattern Validation

1. **Missing Middle Structures?**
   We identified 16 patterns (M1-M16 + T1-T4). Are there middle structures Scott uses that we didn't capture? Particularly interested in:
   - How he builds momentum in event promotion posts
   - Structures for celebrating others (advisor announcements, team wins)

2. **M2 (Parallel Domain) Depth**
   This relies heavily on surfing metaphors. Are there other domains (music, cooking, etc.) that should be documented as middle-structure wells?

3. **M6 (Insider Reveal) Frequency**
   "They say... They don't say..." appears in equity/comp posts. Is this a generalizable pattern or specific to exposing information asymmetry?

### Structure Usage

4. **List Fatigue Threshold**
   We flagged maximum 2 list structures per post. Is this accurate, or are there posts with 3+ lists that still work?

5. **Long Middle Posts**
   Post 31 (5-step qualification) is among the longest. Is there a word/paragraph limit for LinkedIn before engagement drops?

6. **Credential Stack Context**
   M14 notes credentials should only appear when authority matters. Are there contexts where credentials should never appear (vulnerability pieces, community content)?

### Combinations

7. **Middle Stacking**
   Some posts combine M7 (Story Arc) + M10 (Contrast Lists) + M3 (Sequential). Are there combinations that work well together vs. combinations to avoid?

8. **Transition Frequency**
   T1-T4 transitions appear 1-2 times per long post. Is there a maximum before they feel like verbal tics?

### Energy Matching

9. **Opening --> Middle Mismatches**
   Energy Matching Guide shows "Avoid" column. Are there mismatch examples in corpus we should flag as "what not to do"?

10. **O4 (Pithy Truth) Middles**
    We marked O4 as often standalone. When O4 does have a middle, what structure works best?

## Integration Notes

### Cross-References Created

- M2 (Parallel Domain) --> ANECDOTES.md Surfing System
- M5 (Formula Contrast) --> STORIES.md Diagnosis Journey
- M7 (Personal Story Arc) --> STORIES.md (various)
- M14 (Credential Stack) --> THEMES.md "Desperation beats credentials" (tension)
- T1 (Pivot Markers) --> VOICE.md "Here's the thing..." fingerprint

### Pattern Distribution (from 50 posts)

| Pattern | Count | % of Long Posts |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| M3 (Sequential Framework) | 6+ | 40%+ |
| M10 (Contrast Lists) | 5+ | 33%+ |
| M1 (Contrarian Evidence) | 5+ | 33%+ |
| M7 (Personal Story Arc) | 4+ | 27%+ |
| M2 (Parallel Domain) | 4+ | 27%+ |
| M15 (Specific Detail) | 6+ | 40%+ |
| Others | 2-3 each | Varies |

### Tension Summary

1. **Story vs. Framework Balance** - Alternate between human and tactical
2. **List Fatigue** - Maximum 2 list structures per post
3. **Credential Bragging** - Stack only when claim needs authority
4. **Specificity vs. Privacy** - Numbers for business, bounded for personal

### New Patterns Discovered

During synthesis, we identified these patterns not explicitly requested:

- **Transition Techniques (T1-T4):** The pivot phrases that move between sections
- **Middle Length Categories:** Short/Medium/Long matching to opening types
- **"Ask Them About" Reveal (M16):** Diagnostic question that exposes real vs. fake

These were added because they consistently appeared in corpus and serve distinct generation purposes.
