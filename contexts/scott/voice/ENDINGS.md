# ENDINGS

## How to Use Endings

Endings serve three purposes:
1. **Land** - Crystallize the takeaway
2. **Prompt** - Drive engagement (comment, share, save)
3. **Echo** - Reinforce the opening promise

**Selection Process:**
1. What did your opening promise?
2. What did your middle deliver?
3. Pick ending that completes the arc
4. Check BLENDS.md for proven combinations

## Energy Matching Guide

| Opening + Middle Type | Best Endings | Avoid |
|----------------------|--------------|-------|
| O4 (Pithy Truth) standalone | E4 (Pithy Summary) or none | Long endings dilute |
| O5 (Extended Metaphor) + M2 | E19 (Metaphor Return), E4 | E10 (Stop/Start) breaks spell |
| O8 (Personal Stakes) + M7 | E20 (Story Callback), E22 (Engagement Question) | E6 (Math) too cold |
| O3 (Direct Challenge) + M1 | E10 (Stop/Start), E7 (Still Standing) | E22 (Question) too soft |
| O9 (Transformation) + M8 | E6 (Math Close), E21 (We're Proof) | E1 (CTA) undercuts story |
| O10 (Industry Call-Out) + M6 | E17 (Conditional Warning), E15 (That's Where) | E9 (Connection) wrong energy |
| O11 (Binary Contrast) + M10 | E10 (Stop/Start), E14 (Binary Question) | E22 (Question) too open |
| O1 (Bold Stat) + M3 | E5 (Framework Sequence), E15 (That's Where) | E20 (Story Callback) mismatch |
| O7 (Credential + Contrarian) + M14 | E8 (Bold Prediction), E7 (Still Standing) | E1 (CTA) feels salesy |
| Event/Promo content | E1 (Referral), E2 (Do Your Thing), E3 (Event Promo) | E6 (Math) wrong context |

---

## Ending Lengths

### One Line (3-8 words)
For: O4 standalones, pithy content
**Pattern:** E4 (Pithy Summary), E21 (We're Proof)

### Two Lines (1 couplet)
For: Prescription content, contrast posts
**Pattern:** E10 (Stop/Start), E4 + amplification

### Three+ Lines (compound ending)
For: Story content, complex arguments
**Pattern:** E20 + E18 (Story + Urgency), E10 + E7 (Prescription + Wisdom)

---

## Tensions (Generation Guidance)

### CTA Frequency
**Issue:** Too many CTAs feel transactional.
**Rule:** CTAs (E1, E2, E3) should be rare. Most content should end with wisdom (E4-E9) or challenge (E14-E18). Reserve CTAs for explicit promotion posts.

### Question Close Risk
**Issue:** E22 (Engagement Question) can feel like engagement bait.
**Rule:** Only use when question is genuine and reader actually has relevant experience to share. Never use to artificially inflate comments.

### Stop/Start Overuse
**Issue:** E10 is signature but can become predictable.
**Rule:** Vary with E11 (Single Prescription), E4 (Pithy), or E14 (Binary Question). Same energy, different execution.

### Story Callback Requirement
**Issue:** E20 only works if opening was story-based.
**Rule:** If opening was O8 (Personal Stakes) or contained specific story element, callback works. Otherwise, feels forced.

### Platform Considerations
**LinkedIn:** All endings work. E22 (Engagement Question) drives comments.
**Newsletter:** E4 (Pithy Summary) and E5 (Framework) work well. CTAs less necessary.
**Podcast:** E8 (Bold Prediction) and E6 (Math Close) translate well to audio.

## === Rationale ===

### Classification Decisions

**Ending vs. Signature Phrase:**
- **Ending:** Final 1-4 lines that close a post with purpose
- **Signature Phrase:** Repeatable line that can appear anywhere (VOICE.md)

Some phrases are both: "That's not philosophy. That's math." is signature phrase AND E6 ending pattern.

**Ending vs. Voice Pattern:**
- **Ending:** Structural position (last lines) with closing function
- **Voice Pattern:** Sentence-level mechanics (rhythm, punctuation)

E10 (Stop/Start) uses VOICE.md's "Stop/Start Prescription Pairs" pattern in ending position.
