## Core Blend Examples

### B1: Contrarian Takedown

#### Example 1: Real vs. Fake Leaders (Post 8)

**Full Post:**
```
Everyone with a keyboard thinks they're qualified. To sell. To lead. To build.

Including the "sales guru" with 5k followers who's never built a team.

Real sellers and sales leaders leave evidence and receipts.

Reps who become VPs
Teams that hit quota in down markets
Colleagues who follow them from company to company
Actual P & L responsibility
Exits and IPOs and Outcomes

LinkedIn influencers leave different evidence.

Motivational quotes
5 tips for closing deals
Stock photos of pre meditated handshakes
0 mention of their failures, struggles and losses

Influencers discuss culture.
Real leaders build it.

Influencers preach resilience.
Real leaders have scars to prove they live it.

Influencers share frameworks.
Real leaders share results.

Want to spot the difference?
Ask them about their biggest failure.

Real leaders tell you exactly what it cost, professionally and personally.
Who had to be let go.
What they'd do differently.
Why it cost them so much more than they expected.

Influencers?
They've "never really failed, just learned lessons."

Your team doesn't need another thought leader.
They need someone who's been in the trenches.
Who's missed quota and recovered.
Who knows what it costs to be wrong.

Stop hiring for followers and influence.
Start hiring for battle scars and receipts.

The best sellers and leaders aren't necessarily the loudest.
They're the ones still standing, which says it all.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O3 (Direct Challenge) -- "Everyone with a keyboard thinks they're qualified"
- **Middle:** M1 (Contrarian Evidence Stack) + M10 (Contrast Lists) -- Stacked evidence lists, real vs. fake
- **Middle:** M16 (Ask Them About Reveal) -- "Ask them about their biggest failure"
- **Ending:** E10 (Stop/Start Pair) + E7 (Still Standing) -- Double-layer close

**Why It Works:**
The parallel structure ("Influencers X. Real leaders Y.") creates undeniable contrast. The "ask them about" reveal gives readers an actionable test. The compound ending lands both prescription and wisdom.

**Adaptation Notes:**
- Replace "influencers vs. real leaders" with any "appearance vs. substance" topic
- Keep the two-column evidence structure
- Always include the diagnostic question ("Ask them about...")
- End with Stop/Start + wisdom observation

---

### B2: Transformation Proof

#### Example 1: Desperation Beats Credentials (Post 10)

**Full Post:**
```
I'm most proud of the transformations nobody expected.

Farmer who lost everything becomes a CRO and then a Founder.
Ex-con becomes a multi-time VP Sales.

These success stories from teams I've led prove something:
Desperation beats credentials.
Every. Single. Time.

Think about what losing everything teaches you:
How to fight when you've got absolutely nothing left.
How to appreciate every single opportunity presented to you.
How to outwork everyone who's just happy to be there who's had it easier.

Think about what real hardship creates:
The ability to read people.
The hunger to never go back.
The resilience that can't be taught in business school.

Meanwhile, perfect resumes often come with:
No experience with real failure.
No hunger born from loss.
No respect for the limited amount of time we have.

They quit after the first hard quarter.

The underdogs I've worked with?
They've already survived worse than a missed quota.

What I look for now:
Rock bottom stories > Ivy league stories
Hunger that comes from real loss
Resilience rebuilding from absolute zero
Scars that turned into skills

Stop hiring for pedigree.
Start hiring for proof.

The person who climbed their way straight out of hell will outwork and outperform the person who've never left their comfortable beach house that's been in the family for a generation or two.

That's not philosophy.
That's math.

We're proof.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O9 (Transformation Story) -- "I'm most proud of transformations nobody expected"
- **Middle:** M8 (Transformation Proof) -- Pattern across multiple examples
- **Middle:** M10 (Contrast Lists) -- What hardship creates vs. what privilege lacks
- **Ending:** E10 (Stop/Start) + E6 (Math Close) + E21 (We're Proof)

**Why It Works:**
Opens with specific transformations (farmer, ex-con) that create immediate curiosity. "Think about what X teaches" frames build the argument. Triple-layer ending (prescription + math + identity) lands with force.

**Adaptation Notes:**
- Open with 2-3 specific transformation examples
- Use "Think about what X teaches/creates" structure
- Include "Meanwhile" pivot to contrast
- End with "That's not philosophy. That's math."

### B3: Stakes to Prescription

#### Example 1: Hospital to Business (Post 9)

**Full Post:**
```
4 years. 9 surgeries. 1 addiction kicked. That's what it took before I could even start a career in sales.

Now I help founders, sales leaders and sellers escape the overthinking trap. Minus the medical bills and struggles I had to endure.

The overthinking formula I lived:
Research every option
Build contingency plans
Wait for perfect timing
Watch others execute
Repeat from the hospital bed

The action formula that saved me:
Pick 1 thing
Do it today
Fix it tomorrow
Ship it anyway

I had every excuse to wait.
Doctors saying "take it slow."
Body screaming "you're not ready."
0 proof I'd succeed.

Started anyway.

Built my consulting business.
Started coaching.
Wrote books.
Created a platform and a network that brings leads.

Not because I was ready.
Because I was tired of thinking about being ready.

Your competition isn't working harder.
They're thinking less and doing more.

That proposal you're perfecting right now? Send it.
That hire you're analyzing? Make the call.
That pivot you're considering? Start today.

The delta between idea and action determines everything.
I shrunk mine to hours, not months.

Stop planning your escape from mediocrity.
Start executing it.

The hospital bed taught me 1 thing:
Perfect timing is a luxury for people with time to waste.

You don't have it.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O8 (Personal Stakes) -- "4 years. 9 surgeries. 1 addiction kicked."
- **Middle:** M5 (Formula Contrast) -- Overthinking formula vs. action formula
- **Middle:** M7 (Personal Story Arc) -- Journey from hospital to business
- **Ending:** E20 (Story Callback) -- "The hospital bed taught me 1 thing"

**Why It Works:**
The stark numbers in opening (4 years, 9 surgeries) create immediate gravity. The formula contrast makes abstract mindsets concrete. Direct address prescriptions ("That proposal you're perfecting? Send it.") make it actionable. Story callback ties the ending to the opening.

**Adaptation Notes:**
- Open with specific personal stakes (numbers help)
- Use formula contrast structure (wrong formula vs. right formula)
- Include direct address prescriptions
- Close by returning to opening story element

---

### B4: Extended Metaphor

#### Example 1: Surfing = Sales Pipeline (Post 6)

**Full Post:**
```
Surfing teaches you about sales pipelines. I mean hell, one of the most famous surf breaks in the world is literally called "Pipeline" and is considered one of the most dangerous waves in the world due to the reef and unforgiving conditions, making it a spot for only the most experienced surfers.

Fitting.

The best waves and the best deals require the same thing:
Patience, then immediate Action.

Surfing truth: the ocean doesn't care about you
Sales truth: the market doesn't care about you

Both punish overthinking the same way.

In the water:
See the wave forming
Position yourself
Paddle like hell
Commit fully
Or wipe out, hard

In sales:
See the opportunity
Position your value
Push forward
Close it
Or lose it, hard.

The best surfers aren't reading wave analytics.
They're reading the actual water they are in.

The best salespeople aren't perfecting their CRM notes.
They're having actual conversations.

Too many reps spend time analyzing "ideal customer profiles."
Meanwhile, their competitors just called those customers.

The wave you catch beats the perfect wave you missed.
The deal you close beats the perfect deal you're still planning.

Stop waiting for perfect conditions.
Start paddling out.

The ocean rewards action.
So does the market.

And timing beats perfection.
Every time.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O5 (Extended Metaphor) -- "Surfing teaches you about sales pipelines"
- **Middle:** M2 (Parallel Domain Comparison) -- Point-by-point mapping
- **Ending:** E19 (Metaphor Return) + E4 (Pithy Summary) -- "The ocean rewards action. So does the market."

**Why It Works:**
The "Pipeline" literal connection hooks immediately. Parallel lists (In the water / In sales) make the mapping undeniable. Pithy comparisons ("The best surfers aren't reading wave analytics") land insights. Metaphor return in ending creates satisfying loop.

**Adaptation Notes:**
- Find a domain with natural connection to sales/business
- Use parallel list structure for exact mappings
- Include pithy comparisons between domains
- Close by returning to metaphor with extracted wisdom

### B5: Framework Teaching

#### Example 1: Clarity, Relationships, Automation (Post 3)

**Full Post:**
```
Most people went to reInvent to chase the newest AI trick. I went to reInvent in Las Vegas with my friends at Common Room and was reminded of the oldest truth in business. Technology cannot save a company that lacks clarity or relationships.

Clarity plus relationships plus intelligent automation is the formula that wins. Not one or the other. All three together.

Right now every company on the planet is racing to automate as much of their commercial motion as possible. There is nothing wrong with that. Automation is powerful when it amplifies what already works.

But automation without clarity still scales chaos. It does not matter if you are ten people or ten thousand.

If you do not know who your true buyer is
If you do not know why they make decisions
If you do not know the signals that actually move revenue

Then automation will only accelerate confusion.

My time at Amazon reInvent made this obvious. The companies who win are not the ones with the most tools. They are the ones who understand their customer, build real relationships, then use automation to multiply proven motion.

Clarity first. Relationships second. Automation third. That sequence is the competitive advantage.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O2 (Contrarian Pivot) -- "Most people went to X. I went and learned Y."
- **Middle:** M3 (Sequential Framework) -- Three-part formula with order
- **Middle:** M9 (Counter-Argument Demolition) -- "Automation without clarity scales chaos"
- **Ending:** E5 (Framework Sequence Close) -- "Clarity first. Relationships second. Automation third."

**Why It Works:**
The contrarian pivot (what others did vs. what I learned) positions the insight. The conditional structure ("If you do not know...") builds stakes. The framework close restates the sequence as the key takeaway, making it memorable.

**Adaptation Notes:**
- Open with conference/event contrarian pivot if applicable
- State the formula early, then defend it
- Use conditional structures to show stakes of ignoring the framework
- Close by restating the sequence with "That's the advantage"

### B6: Industry Exposé

#### Example 1: Equity Education (Post 12)

**Full Post:**
```
Nobody teaches you about equity at startups.
That's by design.

VCs and founders have information you don't.
And they like it that way.

Your 1% equity sounds great.
Until you learn about liquidation preferences.
Participation rights.
Anti-dilution provisions.

You get the picture. They get paid 1st, 2nd and 3rd.
You get what's left.

They say:
"You're getting stock options"
"We're valued at millions"
"You could get rich"

They don't say:
Your strike price vs current valuation
The preference stack ahead of you
How many rounds until you're diluted to nothingness
That most startups exits return less than invested capital

I learned this the hard way.
Multiple startups.
Worked myself to the bone.
Built and scaled entire orgs from nothing.

The equity? Often worth less than I expected. Always less than I was "sold."

Now when I advise founders I tell them to tell the truth and pay market rate or give meaningful equity, not monopoly money.

Before accepting equity, ask a few questions like:
What's the liquidation preference?
What's the total preference stack?
What's the fully diluted share count?
What happens in a down round?

If they won't give you a straight answer, well, that's your answer.

Your sweat equity is real. Your risk is real.
Make sure theirs is too.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O10 (Industry Call-Out) -- "Nobody teaches you about equity. That's by design."
- **Middle:** M6 (Insider Reveal) -- "They say / They don't say" structure
- **Middle:** M12 (Stacked Questions) -- Questions to ask before accepting equity
- **Ending:** E17 (Conditional Warning) -- "If they won't give you a straight answer..."

**Why It Works:**
The opening positions Scott as insider exposing hidden information. The "They say / They don't say" structure makes information asymmetry visceral. The diagnostic questions give readers immediate tools. The conditional warning ending empowers without preaching.

**Adaptation Notes:**
- Open by naming the hidden truth no one discusses
- Use "They say / They don't say" for information asymmetry
- Include actionable questions readers can use
- Close with conditional that turns non-answer into answer

---

### B7: Pithy Wisdom

#### Example 1: Attention Span (Post 5)

**Full Post:**
```
Your competition is the attention span of your ideal client.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O4 (Pithy Truth) -- Complete in one sentence
- **Middle:** None
- **Ending:** E4 (Pithy Summary) -- Opening IS the ending

**Why It Works:**
Single sentence that reframes how readers think about competition. No elaboration needed--the insight is complete. Maximum engagement with minimum friction.

---

#### Example 2: Recipe Not Vibes (Post 2)

**Full Post:**
```
People learn 30-40% faster when you give them clear steps instead of vague direction.

Show them the recipe, not the vibes.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O1 (Bold Stat) -- "30-40% faster"
- **Middle:** None (too short)
- **Ending:** E4 (Pithy Summary) -- "Show them the recipe, not the vibes"

**Why It Works:**
Stat creates credibility, pithy summary creates memorability. Two sentences, complete thought.

---

#### Example 3: Pain and Urgency (Post 14)

**Full Post:**
```
If there's no pain, there's no change.
If there's no urgency, there's no deal.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O4 (Pithy Truth) with parallel structure
- **Ending:** E4 (Pithy Summary) -- second line reinforces first

**Why It Works:**
Parallel structure creates rhythm and memorability. Two conditional statements that capture fundamental sales truth.

**Adaptation Notes for B7:**
- Keep to 1-3 sentences
- Stat + summary OR pure insight OR parallel structure
- Don't over-explain--trust the reader
- Test ideas in pithy form before expanding

---

### B8: Binary Contrast

#### Example 1: Busy vs. Revenue Work (Post 17)

**Full Post:**
```
Busy work feels productive. Revenue work is productive.

You can grind ten hours a day and still be broke.
Or you can make three real moves and shift your entire worldview.

Busy work
Updating a CRM nobody reads
Polishing decks that never get pitched
Sitting in "alignment" meetings with zero alignment
Rewriting a cold email sequence for the 15th time
Slack debates like you're running a presidential campaign
Content calendars and brainstorming sessions you never hit publish on

Looks serious. Feels safe. Builds nothing.

Revenue Work
Calling people who actually have a problem you solve
Getting in front of decision-makers, not "champions"
Dropping into DMs with a pulse, not a template
Asking uncomfortable questions early
Unlocking urgency instead of begging for timelines
Sending a contract instead of "checking in"

It's uncomfortable. It exposes you. It also moves money every single time.

A lot of people hide in busy work because it shields them from rejection and accountability. Revenue work puts you in the arena. No hiding. No excuses.

Look at your calendar. If most of what you're doing could be done by a polite intern with a laptop and a latte, you're in busy-work mode.

Shift the ratio. Do the uncomfortable things. You don't get paid for being busy. You get paid for being effective.

Do you want to look productive or be dangerous?
One pays rent. The other builds your life.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O11 (Binary Contrast) -- "Busy work feels productive. Revenue work is productive."
- **Middle:** M10 (Contrast Lists) -- Two detailed lists with commentary
- **Ending:** E14 (Binary Choice Question) -- "Do you want to look productive or be dangerous?"

**Why It Works:**
Opening sets up the binary. Specific list items make each category tangible (not abstract). Commentary after each list lands the judgment. Binary question ending forces reader to choose.

**Adaptation Notes:**
- Open with the binary frame (X feels Y. Z is Y.)
- Make list items specific and recognizable
- Add brief commentary after each list
- Close with question that forces choice between the two

### B9: Tactical Framework

#### Example 1: Deal Qualification (Post 31)

**Full Post:**
```
5 steps to qualify deals like a top 1% seller instead of seeing more ghosts than Bill Murray in NYC at Christmas.

You don't lose deals at the close.
You lose them way earlier, usually before you even realize it.

Let me tell you what I mean.

Years ago, when I was scaling a SaaS startup from zero to unicorn status, my reps kept saying the same thing:
"Scott, we had a great call… they just went dark."

No, they didn't "go dark."
You lost them during qualification, you just didn't notice it yet.

Most reps treat qualification like a box-ticking exercise.
The best ones? They treat it like an investigation.

Here's the Cycle of Deal Qualification I've used (and taught to 160+ startups):

1️⃣ Verify the pain, then Quantify the pain
If there's no pain, there's no deal.
Ask:
What's the real cost of doing nothing?
Is this problem a must-fix or a nice-to-have?
Who else is feeling the pain internally?

If they can't articulate pain clearly, congrats, you're about to waste 3 months on a dead deal.

2️⃣ Confirm the budget
"Yeah, we have a budget for this" means absolutely nothing.
Dig deeper:
Is the budget approved or hypothetical?
Who actually signs the checks?
What did they pay last time for something similar?

If you don't know who controls the money, you don't control the deal.

3️⃣ Map the decision process
Most sellers think the decision-maker is the person who talks the most on the call.
Wrong.
The real decision-maker might be the one who doesn't even show up.

Ask:
What's your decision timeline?
Who has veto power?
What could derail this internally?

4️⃣ Assess Fit (Be Honest)
Every deal isn't a fit. And that's okay.
Ask:
What requirements can't we meet right now?
Are we solving your top priorities or side projects?
Do you need something we don't do?

Qualifying out is just as valuable as qualifying in.

5️⃣ Evaluate the competition
If you don't know who else they're talking to, assume it's everyone.
Ask:
Who else is on your shortlist?
What made you consider us in the first place?
Why wouldn't you choose the obvious option?

That last one always gets gold.

The best reps I've ever coached don't chase every deal.
They move fast, qualify hard, and know exactly where a deal stands before they waste another minute.

So before you blame your close rate, check your qualification rate.
That's where the real money leaks happen.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O6 (Provocative Question via title) + story hook
- **Middle:** M3 (Sequential Framework) with M12 (Stacked Questions) at each step
- **Middle:** M7 (Personal Story Arc) -- Brief anecdote about reps saying "they went dark"
- **Ending:** E15 (That's Where Reveal) -- "That's where the real money leaks happen"

**Why It Works:**
Bill Murray reference in title is memorable hook. Story about reps saying "they went dark" creates recognition. Each step includes diagnostic questions readers can use immediately. "That's where" ending redirects blame from close rate to qualification.

**Adaptation Notes:**
- Open with numbered promise and memorable hook
- Include brief story that creates recognition
- Each step needs explanation + diagnostic questions + consequence
- Close by revealing where the real problem is

---

### B10: Leadership Wisdom

#### Example 1: Heart and Spine (Post 26)

**Full Post:**
```
Leading with empathy doesn't make you soft.
It makes you damn effective.

A VP told me last month he avoids giving his team autonomy.
"If I'm too understanding, they'll take advantage."

Understanding and authority aren't opposites.
They're a combo.

I've seen it for 20 years:
Leaders think they have to pick.
Be liked or be respected.
Lead with heart or with head.

So they pull back.
They get distant.
All strategy, no connection.

And they wonder why their best people bounce.

Here's what that costs you:
→ Trust falls apart.
→ People stop speaking up.
→ You miss the real problems.
→ Nobody's learning how to lead.

The best leaders don't choose. They blend both.
They care about people and performance.
They listen and expect results.

That's not being "nice."
That's being smart.

You want to build something that lasts?
Lead with heart and spine.

If you lead people, read this twice.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O11 (Binary Contrast) -- "Empathy doesn't make you soft. It makes you effective."
- **Middle:** M7 (Personal Story Arc) -- VP anecdote
- **Middle:** M13 (Arrow Cascade) -- "Here's what that costs you"
- **Ending:** E11 (Single Prescription) + E12 (Read This Twice)

**Why It Works:**
Opening reframes false dichotomy. Real anecdote (VP quote) grounds the lesson. Arrow cascade shows specific costs of the wrong approach. "Heart and spine" is memorable prescription. "Read this twice" signals importance.

**Adaptation Notes:**
- Open by reframing a false dichotomy
- Include real anecdote that illustrates the wrong approach
- Use arrow cascade to show costs
- Close with memorable single prescription

## Specialty Blend Examples

### Event Promotion Blend

#### Example 1: Midnight to Millions (Post 19)

**Full Post:**
```
Working 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week is for the young and dumb. A generation burning themselves into dust doing "hustle cosplay." Decks. Standups. Zoom fatigue. Busywork disguised as ambition. That era will be short-lived. Not because people got soft, but because it was stupid.

Real growth doesn't come from grinding yourself into paste. It comes from intensity, clarity, and actual breakthroughs. You can get that in a day of hard work, but it's unsustainable and unhealthy to do it daily.

I'll prove it Thursday, when I stay up for leading for 24 speakers bringing you 24 breakthroughs for 24 hours straight. It's not grind. It's focus. Not fake urgency.

Real transformation. It's a day, and we do hard things ONCE in awhile.

I don't pull all-nighters for pitch decks. I don't pull all-nighters for fundraising panic or "crisis mode." But I'll stay awake 24 hours for one thing: Actual operators tearing the wrapper off what's stopping your revenue engine from scaling and bringing you breakthrough moments.

I'm staying up all night because I believe something rare still exists in this industry: Rooms where real operators tell the truth. About:
Selling without sounding like AI wrote your playbook
Building when capital is expensive and patience is thin
Scaling without losing your team or your mind
Standing out in a world full of recycled advice

Pull up if you're tired of pretending incremental progress is enough.
It's free. It's live. And every registrant gets all 24 recorded sessions.

We stay up, so you don't have to.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O3 (Direct Challenge) -- Anti-hustle opening
- **Middle:** M7 (Story Arc) -- Why this event matters
- **Middle:** M11 (Numbered Priority) via benefits list
- **Ending:** E3 (Event Promo) + E24 (Service Tagline)

**Why It Works:**
Opens with contrarian take (anti-hustle) that aligns with brand. Justifies why this event is different. Benefits list is specific. "We stay up, so you don't have to" is memorable tagline.

---

### Job Posting Blend

#### Example 1: Donut Press SDR (Post 1)

**Full Post:**
```
Late last year I wrote the single biggest angel investment check of my life.

And now that company is hiring their first full-time SDR.

This is one of those early-stage roles where the right person changes the trajectory of the entire business.

Company: Donut Press Media
Comp: $40k–$50k base / $80k–$100k OTE / 10 bps
Location: Anywhere USA (Austin ideal)

Why this matters:
Joining at this stage means learning directly from the founders [former sellers btw], owning real pipeline, and building the outbound engine from scratch. Role is perfect for someone in the earlier stages of their career looking to improve their sales development skills.

If you're early in your career and ready to bet on yourself, this is how you level up fast.

If you know someone who should see this, send it their way. If it's you, DM me.

Do your thing LinkedIn.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O8 (Personal Stakes) -- "Biggest angel investment check of my life"
- **Middle:** M15 (Specific Detail Proof) -- Comp, location, equity specifics
- **Ending:** E1 (Direct Referral) + E2 (Do Your Thing)

**Why It Works:**
Personal stake creates credibility for the opportunity. Specific details (comp range, equity points) build trust. Two-path CTA (share or apply) maximizes reach. "Do your thing LinkedIn" invokes community.

---

### Surf and Sales Blend

#### Example 1: Portugal Summit (Post 25)

**Full Post:**
```
There's something different about starting your day with a surfboard instead of a spreadsheet.

Last week, we wrapped the first-ever European Surf & Sales in Portugal — a week that blended growth, adventure, and community in ways I didn't expect.

But what made this one truly special wasn't just the setting.
It was purpose.

This was the first Surf & Sales Summit with a charitable sponsor — and together, we raised $5K for Provide the Slide, an NGO sending used surfboards to communities across West Africa.

They've already shipped over 1,500 boards to 11 coastal towns, giving young people the chance to build skills, confidence, and even livelihoods through surfing.

The funds from this event will help ship 280 more boards from Australia to Benin, Liberia, Ghana, Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Sierra Leone — complete with fins, leashes, and wax so they're ready to ride.

The Surf and Sales Summit was always about connection.
This week reminded me that connection goes far beyond business.
```

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Opening:** O5 (Extended Metaphor) -- "Surfboard instead of a spreadsheet"
- **Middle:** M15 (Specific Detail Proof) -- Numbers, locations, impact
- **Ending:** E9 (Connection Beyond Business)

**Why It Works:**
Opens with the contrast that defines Surf and Sales. Specific numbers (1,500 boards, 11 towns, $5K raised) create credibility. Ending elevates from event recap to meaning.

## Length Range Examples

### Short Form (1-3 lines)

**Example (Post 5):**
```
Your competition is the attention span of your ideal client.
```
-- 1 line, B7 (Pithy Wisdom), O4 + E4

**Example (Post 14):**
```
If there's no pain, there's no change.
If there's no urgency, there's no deal.
```
-- 2 lines, B7 (Pithy Wisdom), O4 parallel structure

**Example (Post 4):**
```
Everyone's missing quota and scrolling LinkedIn like AI is the cure.

Real leaders fix their team with coaching, not wishful thinking.
```
-- 2 lines, O3 (Direct Challenge) + E4 (Pithy Summary)

---

### Medium Form (1-2 paragraphs)

**Example (Post 3 - Framework Teaching):**
- ~150 words
- O2 + M3 + E5
- Conference recap with framework

**Example (Post 26 - Leadership Wisdom):**
- ~200 words
- O11 + M13 + E11
- Binary contrast with arrow cascade

---

### Long Form (3+ paragraphs)

**Example (Post 8 - Contrarian Takedown):**
- ~350 words
- O3 + M1 + M10 + E10 + E7
- Full evidence stacking with compound ending

**Example (Post 31 - Tactical Framework):**
- ~500 words
- O6 + M3 + M12 + E15
- Numbered framework with diagnostic questions

---

## Edge Cases

### Hybrid Blend Example

**Post 47: Soccer Tragedy Story**

This post blends B3 (Stakes to Prescription) with vulnerability content but ends with engagement question (E22) rather than typical prescription:

```
The summer before college I got a phone call I'll never forget.

A horrific car accident.
One of my high-school soccer teammates died. Others were badly hurt.

[...story arc...]

How have you kept moving when everything in you said stop?

In the end, you do it anyway because the alternative is not the best version of you that exists. And you and the universe deserves your best.
```

**Why It's Edge Case:**
Standard B3 would end with story callback (E20) or prescription (E10). This ends with engagement question (E22) then adds wisdom. Works because the vulnerability earns the question.

---

### One-Off Success

**Post 48: Maybe It's You**

```
One thing that drives me crazy is when the new VP Sales comes in [regardless of stage] and does not take the time to learn the product and pitch and makes zero effort to sell.

Don't be that sales leader. But...

When you're on your 4th sales leader in less than two years... All of whom have had different titles...and backgrounds...

I don't know man...
Maybe it's you.
```

**Why It's Unique:**
This doesn't fit standard blends. It's a rant that pivots responsibility. The "I don't know man..." creates conversational intimacy. "Maybe it's you" is confrontational in a way most content avoids.

## Anti-Examples (What Not to Do)

### Energy Mismatch

**Constructed Anti-Example:**

```
4 years. 9 surgeries. 1 addiction kicked. [O8 Personal Stakes]

[...vulnerable story...]

Want to learn more? DM me to book a call! [E1 Direct CTA]
```

**Why It Fails:**
Vulnerability opening undercut by sales CTA. The earned intimacy is betrayed by transactional close. Should end with E20 (Story Callback) or E22 (Engagement Question).

### Promise-Delivery Mismatch

**Constructed Anti-Example:**

```
Your competition is the attention span of your ideal client. [O4 Pithy Truth]

Let me break this down in 5 steps...
1. First, you need to...
2. Second, consider...
[Long framework that doesn't deliver on pithy promise]
```

**Why It Fails:**
Pithy opening promises quick insight. Long framework breaks that promise. Either keep it pithy (B7) or open with framework promise (O1).
