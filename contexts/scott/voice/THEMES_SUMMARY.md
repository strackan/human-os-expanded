## 50/50 Calls Made

### 1. Surfing: Belief vs Habit
**Decision:** Habit (mental reset practice)
**Rationale:** Philosophical content ("timing beats perfection") captured in Action Beats Perfection. Metaphor usage routes to VOICE.md.
**Confidence:** Medium-High

### 2. Pipeline 12:1 Ratio: Belief vs Habit
**Decision:** Moved to Habit
**Rationale:** The specific 12:1 number is tactical/operational. Underlying philosophy ("over-prepare for uncertainty") is bedrock, but the ratio itself may evolve with sales tech. Kept as operational best practice.
**Confidence:** Medium

### 3. Meetings Booked: Belief vs Habit
**Decision:** Kept as Belief
**Rationale:** "Stop celebrating busy. Start rewarding impact." is philosophical bedrock about measuring outcomes vs. activity. Would defend under pressure 10 years from now.
**Confidence:** High

### 4. Music All Day: Include or Exclude
**Decision:** Included as Habit with low confidence
**Rationale:** Single mention but humanizing detail
**Confidence:** Low

### 5. 14 Beliefs vs Consolidate to 10
**Decision:** Kept 14 (reduced from 15 after Pipeline move)
**Rationale:** Each distinct, natural clustering makes them navigable
**Confidence:** High

## === Open Questions for Sculptor ===

These require Scott's input to resolve.

### 50/50 Calls

1. **Surfing Depth**
   We placed surfing as a Habit (mental reset). The philosophy ("timing beats perfection") landed under Action Beats Perfection. Does surfing carry deeper meaning deserving its own Belief?

2. **Pipeline 12:1 -- Hill to Die On?**
   Is the 12:1 ratio immutable, or a current best practice that might evolve? We moved it to Habits assuming tactical, but if this is non-negotiable bedrock, it should return to Beliefs.

3. **Music All Day**
   Found one mention. Is this still part of your daily rhythm?

### Tensions to Resolve

4. **Hustle Evolution**
   Early content (2019-2020): "outwork everyone." Current content: explicitly anti-hustle. How do you reconcile? Is early framing dead, or situationally appropriate (e.g., for entry-level)?

5. **SDR Paradox**
   You say SDR role is dying, but your biggest angel investment is hiring an SDR. We reconciled as "AI kills SDR long-term, early-stage still benefits from human loops." Accurate?

### Gaps to Fill

6. **Sobriety as Current Identity**
   Addiction/recovery is central to your story. But we didn't find recent content about sobriety as present-tense identity. Is this still defining, or more historical context now?

7. **Family in Content**
   Janet, Brayden, Caleb appear in corpus but we excluded from THEMES. Should family be a Belief ("Family grounds everything") or stay biographical context?
