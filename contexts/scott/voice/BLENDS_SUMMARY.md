## 50/50 Calls Made

### 1. How Many Core Blends?
**Decision:** 10 core blends (B1-B10)
**Rationale:** Represents distinct content archetypes with different formulas and purposes. Fewer would miss important patterns; more would create overlap.
**Confidence:** High

### 2. Pithy Wisdom: Blend or Non-Blend?
**Decision:** Include as B7 despite minimal structure
**Rationale:** O4 + E4 (sometimes no middle) is a deliberate formula. It's not "no blend"--it's a specific recipe for quick-hit content.
**Confidence:** High

### 3. Specialty Blends: Separate Section or Integrated?
**Decision:** Separate section for 4 specialty blends
**Rationale:** Event Promotion, Job Posting, Surf and Sales, and CS Advocacy serve specific purposes that don't fit general content goals. Worth calling out separately.
**Confidence:** High

### 4. Anti-Blends: How Many?
**Decision:** 7 anti-blends documented
**Rationale:** These are combinations that create energy mismatch or structural incoherence. Worth flagging to prevent common mistakes.
**Confidence:** Medium-High

### 5. Blend Variations: How Flexible?
**Decision:** Include 2-3 variations per blend with specific O#/M#/E# swaps
**Rationale:** Blends are recipes, not straitjackets. Showing acceptable substitutions makes them usable without being rigid.
**Confidence:** High

### 6. Example Posts: Verbatim or Reconstructed?
**Decision:** Mix--verbatim where possible, condensed where too long
**Rationale:** Full posts show the blend in action. Some posts (like Post 31) are too long to include fully but the pattern is clear.
**Confidence:** High

## === Open Questions for Sculptor ===

### Blend Validation

1. **Conscious Blends?**
   Are these combinations Scott consciously uses, or patterns that emerged naturally? Does he think in terms of "I'm going to use the Contrarian Takedown today"?

2. **Missing Blends?**
   Are there content types or combinations Scott uses that we didn't capture? Particularly:
   - Community celebration content
   - Advisor announcement content
   - Book/content promotion content

3. **Blend Preferences?**
   Which blends does Scott prefer? Are there blends he's moving away from?

### Blend Gaps

4. **Podcast Content Blend?**
   We focused on LinkedIn. Is there a distinct blend for podcast episode promotion?

5. **Newsletter Blend?**
   Are newsletter structures different enough to warrant their own blend?

6. **Thread/Carousel Blend?**
   For multi-post content, is there a specific structure?

### New Blend Requests

7. **Emerging Blends?**
   Are there blend combinations Scott wants to develop that aren't established in corpus yet?

8. **Platform-Specific Blends?**
   Should there be distinct blends for Instagram, TikTok, or other platforms?

### Anti-Blend Validation

9. **Accurate Anti-Blends?**
   Are the 7 anti-blends accurate? Any combinations flagged that actually work?

10. **Missing Anti-Blends?**
    Are there other combinations that should be avoided?

### Tension Summary

1. **Blend Rigidity** - Use as starting point, not straitjacket
2. **Frequency Mixing** - Rotate through blends to prevent predictability
3. **Opening-Middle Length Match** - Investment should match
4. **Ending Weight** - Compound endings for long posts only
5. **Story Callback Requirement** - Only works with story opening
