## Source Prioritization
| Tier | Weight | Sources |
|------|--------|---------|
| Primary | Highest | linkedin-posts-2025-12.md (Voice Analysis Notes), DIGEST.md (Voice Patterns) |
| Secondary | Medium | newsletters-archive-2019-2025.md (tone differences) |
| Historical | Lowest | podcast transcripts (profanity calibration) |

## 50/50 Calls Made

### 1. Wu-Tang References: Voice or Anecdote?
**Decision:** Kept in VOICE.md as signature phrases
**Rationale:** "Protect your neck" and "I got moves you ain't never seen" are verbal fingerprints, not stories. They're phrases he drops into content, not extended narratives.
**Confidence:** Medium-High

### 2. Opening Hook Patterns: Voice or Structure?
**Decision:** Routed to OPENINGS.md
**Rationale:** The 10 opening patterns (Bold stat, Contrarian pivot, etc.) are content structure, not sentence-level voice mechanics. VOICE.md focuses on how he sounds, not how he organizes.
**Confidence:** High

### 3. Content Archetypes: Voice or Blends?
**Decision:** Routed to BLENDS.md
**Rationale:** "Pithy wisdom," "Contrarian take + evidence," "Personal story --> lesson" are content types/recipes, not voice patterns. They combine voice elements, not define them.
**Confidence:** High

### 4. Profanity Level: Always or Never?
**Decision:** Created a Tension instead
**Rationale:** Profanity is context-dependent (LinkedIn vs. podcast), not a binary rule. Documented in Tensions section with platform-detection guidance.
**Confidence:** High

### 5. "Right?" Tag Frequency
**Decision:** Included with Medium confidence
**Rationale:** Appears consistently in newsletters but less in LinkedIn posts. May be more conversational/spoken than written. Flagged for Sculptor input.
**Confidence:** Medium

### 6. Exclamation Mark Policy
**Decision:** Included as implicit "Never overuse"
**Rationale:** Counted 0-1 per post across corpus. This restraint is notable and worth documenting.
**Confidence:** High

## Open Questions for Sculptor

These require Scott's input to resolve.

### 50/50 Calls

1. **"Right?" Tag**
   We see this in newsletters but less in LinkedIn. Is this a conscious choice for conversational tone, or does it happen naturally in certain writing modes?

2. **Wu-Tang Depth**
   We found 2-3 explicit references. Are there other hip-hop/music references we missed that are part of your verbal identity?

3. **Exclamation Marks**
   You use them rarely (0-1 per post). Is this intentional restraint, or just not your style?

### Tensions to Resolve

4. **Profanity Calibration**
   LinkedIn = restrained, Podcast = liberal. Is this platform-conscious choice, or does spoken vs. written naturally differ?

5. **Formality Shift**
   Newsletters quote philosophers (Darwin, Marcus Aurelius). LinkedIn never does. Intentional differentiation?

6. **Hustle Evolution**
   Early content: "grind at 9:30pm Friday." Current: "9-9 is for young and dumb." When writing for entry-level audience, should we use earlier framing or always use current anti-hustle stance?

### Low Confidence Items

7. **"Look..." Opener**
   We flagged this as a fingerprint but found fewer examples than expected. Confirm if this is actually characteristic?

8. **Ellipses Usage**
   Rare in LinkedIn, slightly more in newsletters. Is this intentional or incidental?
