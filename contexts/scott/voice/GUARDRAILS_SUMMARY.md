# GUARDRAILS.md Synthesis Summary

## What Was Built
- 5 Topics to avoid (with rationale)
- 5 Tones to avoid (with examples)
- 7 Phrases to avoid (with alternatives)
- 8 Sacred Cows (non-negotiable identities)
- 10 Hard NOs (absolute boundaries)
- 6 Evolution items (position changes over time)
- 3 Tensions documented

## Source Prioritization
| Tier | Weight | Sources |
|------|--------|---------|
| Primary | Highest | DIGEST.md (Sacred Cows, Hard NOs, Never-Say, Evolution table) |
| Secondary | High | VOICE.md (queued topic restrictions) |
| Tertiary | Medium | linkedin-posts-2025-12.md (current positioning) |

## 50/50 Calls Made

### 1. Religion/Spirituality: Topic Avoid or Not Mentioned?
**Decision:** Added to Topics to Avoid
**Rationale:** Despite health journey providing natural opportunity to discuss faith/spirituality, it's completely absent. This feels intentional, not accidental.
**Confidence:** Medium-High

### 2. Competitor Criticism: Hard NO or Topic Avoid?
**Decision:** Topic to Avoid (not Hard NO)
**Rationale:** He doesn't attack competitors by name, but this seems more about professional courtesy than deep principle. Not as absolute as other Hard NOs.
**Confidence:** Medium

### 3. Single-Employer Dependency: Hard NO or Belief?
**Decision:** Hard NO
**Rationale:** "Employment security vs job security" is advice he gives, but the absolute framing ("never depend on one company") makes it a boundary, not just a belief.
**Confidence:** High

### 4. Process Addiction: Sacred Cow or Belief?
**Decision:** Sacred Cow
**Rationale:** It's a book title and identity marker, not just something he believes. It defines who he is.
**Confidence:** High

### 5. Follower Milestones: Contradicts Impact Over Vanity?
**Decision:** Documented as Tension, not contradiction
**Rationale:** LinkedIn followers = business development tool. Meetings booked = false proxy for revenue. Different metrics serve different purposes.
**Confidence:** Medium-High

### 6. "Grind" Messaging: Completely Forbidden?
**Decision:** Context-dependent (documented in Evolution)
**Rationale:** Earlier framing still valid for entry-level audience. Evolution isn't erasure -- it's audience-appropriate positioning.
**Confidence:** High

## Open Questions for Sculptor

These require Scott's input to resolve.

### 50/50 Calls

1. **Religion/Spirituality Omission**
   Is the absence of faith/spirituality content intentional? Should AI generation ever touch this topic if it feels authentic, or is it a hard boundary?

2. **Competitor Mentions**
   Would you ever name-check a competitor positively (e.g., "Company X does this well")? Or is all competitor mention off-limits?

3. **Financial Numbers**
   You mention $0-25M ARR range. Are there other specific numbers that are okay to reference, or keep all financials vague?

### Tensions to Resolve

4. **Hustle Message for SDRs**
   When writing for entry-level sales audience, should we use the earlier "grind" framing or always use current "work smart" positioning?

5. **AI Disruption Nuance**
   The "humans want humans? bullshit" position is strong. When advising enterprise sellers, should we soften this or maintain the contrarian edge?

### Gaps to Fill

6. **New Hard NOs**
   Are there other absolute boundaries we missed? Things you'd never say or topics you'd never touch that aren't captured here?

7. **Sacred Cow Ranking**
   If forced to rank the 8 Sacred Cows, which are most inviolable? (For generation priority when space is limited)
