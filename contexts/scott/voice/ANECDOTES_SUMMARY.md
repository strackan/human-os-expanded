### Note on "Bob" Story
The "Bob" ramping story was referenced as coming from OutboundEngine but not found with full detail in corpus. Included YORO content instead as primary ramping illustration. Flag for Sculptor: Is there a specific "Bob" story that should be documented?

## Source Prioritization

| Tier | Weight | Sources |
|------|--------|---------|
| Primary | Highest | DIGEST.md (Recurring References), linkedin-posts-2025-12.md (metaphor usage) |
| Secondary | High | podcast-revenue-io-survivor-2020.md (teaching illustrations) |
| Tertiary | Medium | interview-gong-2019-12.md (sports analogies), newsletters-archive (YORO) |
| Reference | Lowest | CONTEXT.md (biographical details) |

## 50/50 Calls Made

### 1. Surfing: Metaphor System or Signature Phrases?
**Decision:** Metaphor System (kept in ANECDOTES.md)
**Rationale:** Surfing is a domain of related metaphors, not individual repeatable phrases. "Pipeline," "paddling out," "ocean doesn't care" are situational deployments from the same well.
**Confidence:** High

### 2. "Garbage Can of Jobs": Anecdote or Signature Phrase?
**Decision:** Pop Culture Reference (kept in ANECDOTES.md)
**Rationale:** It's an original Scott creation used to reclaim sales identity. Functions more like a teaching illustration than a sentence-level voice pattern.
**Confidence:** Medium-High

### 3. YORO: Anecdote or Signature Phrase?
**Decision:** Teaching Illustration (ANECDOTES.md) + Signature Phrase (VOICE.md)
**Rationale:** Exists in both places. VOICE.md has it as repeatable phrase. ANECDOTES.md has the full teaching context.
**Confidence:** High

### 4. Verbal Tics: VOICE.md or ANECDOTES.md?
**Decision:** Kept in ANECDOTES.md
**Rationale:** These are smaller than VOICE.md's "Always" patterns. They're conversational filler that adds authenticity, not defining voice mechanics.
**Confidence:** Medium

### 5. Medical Details: Include or Exclude?
**Decision:** Included as Metaphor System (limited)
**Rationale:** "41 food allergies" and "paleo-ish" are recurring references that humanize. More graphic medical content stays in STORIES.md.
**Confidence:** High

### 6. "Bob" Story: Missing or Different Name?
**Decision:** Flagged as gap
**Rationale:** Referenced in CONTEXT.md as OutboundEngine story but no full detail found. May be conflated with YORO content or use different framing.
**Confidence:** Low--needs Sculptor input

## === Open Questions for Sculptor ===

### Frequency Validation

1. **Wu-Tang Frequency**
   We found 2-3 explicit Wu-Tang references. Are there more we missed, or is this the accurate frequency?

2. **Bill Murray Usage**
   Found 1 explicit Ghostbusters reference in LinkedIn. Is this a recurring reference or one-off that felt memorable?

3. **"Right?" Tag Deployment**
   More common in newsletters than LinkedIn. Is this intentional platform difference?

### Missing Anecdotes

4. **"Bob" Ramping Story**
   Referenced as OutboundEngine story. What's the actual narrative? Is "Bob" a real person or placeholder name?

5. **Other Mentor References**
   Beyond Mike Lindstrom, are there other mentors with story-worthy moments?

6. **Richard Harris Anecdotes**
   Referenced as Surf and Sales co-host but no specific anecdotes captured. Any signature moments?

### Dated References

7. **Wu-Tang Age Range**
   36 Chambers is 1993. Does Scott want to keep using these for Gen Z audiences, or only for 35+ demographic?

8. **Bill Murray Generational Gap**
   Ghostbusters is 1984. Same question--keep or modernize?

### Usage Guidance

9. **Pet Peeves: Positive or Negative?**
   When deploying pet peeves, should they always be followed by a better alternative, or can they stand alone as frustration?

10. **Medical References: Frequency Cap?**
    How often is too often to reference health journey / food allergies in content?
