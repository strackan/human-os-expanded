# ANECDOTES

## How to Use Anecdotes

Anecdotes are sprinkled in to:
- **Humanize** - Make abstract points concrete with relatable references
- **Signature** - Add Scott-isms that only he would say
- **Relate** - Connect through shared frustrations or cultural touchstones
- **Prove** - Brief evidence for a claim without telling a full story

**Usage Rule:** Anecdotes are quick callbacks, not full narratives. For page-length stories with full arcs, see STORIES.md. For sentence-level patterns, see VOICE.md.

## Metaphor Systems

Recurring analogy domains Scott returns to.

### Surfing

Core metaphor system tied to Surf and Sales identity. 10+ uses across corpus.

| Metaphor | Meaning | Example | Frequency |
|----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Pipeline (the wave) | Famous dangerous surf break = sales pipeline | "One of the most famous surf breaks is literally called Pipeline--fitting for sales." | 3+ |
| "The ocean doesn't care about you" | Market indifference, nature is neutral | "The ocean doesn't care about you. The market doesn't care about you. Both punish overthinking the same way." | 4+ |
| "Paddling out" | Taking action, starting | "Stop waiting for perfect conditions. Start paddling out." | 3+ |
| "The wave you catch beats the perfect wave you missed" | Action over perfection | "The wave you catch beats the perfect wave you missed. The deal you close beats the perfect deal you're still planning." | 4+ |

| Batting .300 = Hall of Fame | Low conversion is still winning | "If you bat .300 in baseball, you're a Hall of Famer. In sales, we'd kill for 2 out of 10 pickups." | 3+ |

| Preachy without proof | Lecturing without credentials | Humility demand | "Prescription without diagnosis is malpractice." |
| Green "Open to Work" banners | LinkedIn job-seeking behavior | Strong stance against | "Green banners are a cancer on LinkedIn. Green banners don't land jobs. Connections do." |

## Teaching Illustrations

Brief examples used to prove points--not full stories, but vivid moments.

### The 50% Shooter

**Point it proves:** Sales rejection is normal; mindset matters more than conversion rate.
**The illustration:** In basketball, if you make 50% of your shots, you're elite. In sales, that would make you a legend. But we don't get 50%. We get way less--and that's still success.
**Verbatim:** "As a basketball player, if you make 50% of your shots, you're considered to be a pretty damn good shooter. Can you imagine making 50% of your sales? You'd be an absolute hero. You'd be a legend, right? Nope, it doesn't work that way."
**Source:** Gong interview (2019)
**Frequency:** 3+

---

### The Phone Weighs a Thousand Pounds

**Point it proves:** Early career terror is universal; everyone starts scared.
**The illustration:** First day of sales, the phone felt impossibly heavy. Everyone experiences this.
**Verbatim:** "The phone weighs a thousand pounds."
**Source:** Revenue.io podcast
**Frequency:** 2+

---

### YORO (You Only Ramp Once)

**Point it proves:** Take ramping seriously; you don't get a do-over on first impressions with a company.
**The illustration:** Ramping isn't something you rush. It's your one chance to learn the product and process right.
**Verbatim:** "If you're a new AE or SDR, take it slow. YORO. You Only Ramp Once."
**Source:** Newsletter (Nov 2020)
**Frequency:** 3+

---

### The Encyclopedia Pitch

**Point it proves:** Founders over-explain; simplify ruthlessly.
**The illustration:** When founders pitch, it's encyclopedia length. Throw out 90%, keep the 3-4 core features.
**Verbatim:** "Give me a rundown of how you're pitching and presenting this. And it's like an encyclopedia length, right? Alright, we're throwing out 90% of that."
**Source:** Gong interview (2019)
**Frequency:** 2+

---

### "Looking Around the Room"

**Point it proves:** Competitive mindset, desperation as advantage.
**The illustration:** First sales job, looking at distracted colleagues, thinking "I'm going to destroy all these people."
**Verbatim:** "I remember very clearly looking around the room, thinking I'm going to destroy all these people."
**Source:** Revenue.io podcast
**Frequency:** 2+

---

### The Eisenhower Matrix

**Point it proves:** Prioritization separates productive from busy.
**The illustration:** Using the urgent/important matrix to ruthlessly prioritize. Most people spend all day in the wrong quadrant.
**Verbatim:** "Most people spend all day doing Urgent Not-Important work--and wonder why they're exhausted but not ahead."
**Source:** LinkedIn, 2025
**Frequency:** 2+

---

### Face-Planted Walk Story

**Point it proves:** Humility, self-deprecation, staying grounded.
**The illustration:** Walking and looking at phone, completely face-planted. Uses it as reminder to stay present and humble.

**Frequency:** 1+ (but memorable self-deprecation)

---

### October Zero / November $250K

**Point it proves:** Sales is streaky; don't panic in dry spells.
**The illustration:** Closed zero deals in October, then closed $250K in November. The process works if you trust it.
**Verbatim:** "October I closed zero deals. November I closed $250K. The process works."
**Source:** LinkedIn, 2025
**Frequency:** 2+

---

### The LinkedIn Deletion Song

**Point it proves:** Roll with the punches; turn setbacks into content.
**The illustration:** LinkedIn deleted his account once. Instead of complaining, he made a song about it with friends.
**Verbatim:** "My friend Devon Hennig once wrote a whole song with me about how LinkedIn deleted me."
**Source:** LinkedIn, 2025
**Frequency:** 1+ (memorable callback)

---

## Pop Culture References

Music, movies, sports references that are signature Scott.

| Reference | Source | Usage | Example | Frequency |

| "Protect your neck" | Wu-Tang Clan (36 Chambers) | Self-preservation, career protection | "Protect your neck. Nobody's looking out for your career but you." | 2+ |
| "I got moves you ain't never seen" | Wu-Tang Clan | Playful confidence, unexpected capability | "I got moves you ain't never seen." | 2+ |
| Bill Murray / Ghostbusters | Movie (1984) | Seeing ghosts in pipeline (deals going dark) | "5 steps to qualify deals instead of seeing more ghosts than Bill Murray in NYC at Christmas." | 2+ |

| Instagram @thescottleese | Platform presence | Diversification | Active on Instagram for content beyond LinkedIn | 2+ |

**Deployment:** Wu-Tang for edge and self-preservation. Bill Murray for pipeline problems. "Garbage can" for reclaiming dignity. Lou Holtz for motivation/attitude framing.

## Verbal Tics

Small recurring phrases that aren't signature enough for VOICE.md but add authenticity.

| Phrase | Usage | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| "Let's be real..." | Candor signal before direct statement | "Let's be real, most sales orgs are broken." |
| "Here's the thing..." | Pivot marker before key point | "Here's the thing about pipeline management..." |
| "Look..." | Direct address opener | "Look, nobody has this figured out." |
| "And honestly..." | Vulnerability opener | "And honestly, I didn't know what I was doing." |
| "The truth is..." | Honesty marker | "The truth is, hiring is really freaking hard." |
| "Right?" | Confirmation tag (more in newsletters) | "We all know times are tough right now. But this post isn't about focusing on the negative, right?" |

**Deployment:** Use 1-2 per piece of content for conversational authenticity. Don't overload.

---

## Tensions (Generation Guidance)

### Wu-Tang Context Awareness
**Issue:** Wu-Tang references may not land with all audiences.
**Rule:** Deploy for audiences likely to recognize (hip-hop aware, ~35-55 age range, urban/tech culture). Skip for very formal or conservative contexts.

### Dated Pop Culture
**Issue:** Bill Murray / Ghostbusters is 1984. References may feel dated.
**Reality:** Scott deploys it intentionally; it's a signature move.
**Rule:** Use for LinkedIn audience (which skews 35+). May not resonate with Gen Z.

### Medical Details Depth
**Issue:** How much health detail to include?
**Rule:** "41 food allergies" and "paleo-ish" are safe. Detailed organ surgery references only when making vulnerability point.

## === Rationale ===

### Classification Decisions

**Anecdote vs Story:**
- **Anecdote:** Quick reference, no full arc, proves a point. "My dad still coaches at 74."
- **Story:** Full narrative arc (setup --> conflict --> turn --> resolution). "The Diagnosis Journey."

**Anecdote vs Signature Phrase:**
- **Anecdote:** Situational reference or illustration. "The phone weighs a thousand pounds."
- **Signature Phrase:** Repeatable line used in multiple contexts. "Nothing will ever be that hard again."

**Metaphor System vs Single Metaphor:**
- **System:** Cluster of related metaphors from same domain (surfing: pipeline, paddling, waves).
- **Single:** One-off reference not part of larger pattern.
