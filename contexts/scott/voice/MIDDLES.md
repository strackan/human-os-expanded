# MIDDLES

## How to Use Middles

Middles serve one purpose: **Deliver on the promise.**

The opening hooked attention. The middle must earn it. Scott's middles:
- **Structure** - Organize ideas so they build momentum
- **Evidence** - Back claims with proof, credentials, or concrete examples
- **Rhythm** - Balance lists, stories, and punchy transitions

**Usage Rule:** Match middle structure to opening type. A contrarian opening needs evidence. A story opening needs arc. A framework opening needs steps.

---

## Argument Structures

### M1: Contrarian Evidence Stack

**Description:** Challenge conventional wisdom, then stack proof that your position is right. Build credibility through accumulated examples.

**When to use:** After O3 (Direct Challenge), O7 (Credential + Contrarian), O13 (Dismissive Setup)

**Structure:**
```
[Challenge conventional wisdom]
[Evidence list showing why it's wrong]
[Counter-evidence showing what actually works]
[Proof through specifics]
```

**Example (Post 8):**
```
Real sellers and sales leaders leave evidence and receipts.

Reps who become VPs
Teams that hit quota in down markets
Colleagues who follow them from company to company
Actual P & L responsibility
Exits and IPOs and Outcomes

LinkedIn influencers leave different evidence.

Motivational quotes
5 tips for closing deals
Stock photos of pre meditated handshakes
0 mention of their failures, struggles and losses
```

**Why it works:** Contrast lists make abstract concepts concrete. The stacked evidence creates undeniable pattern.
**Frequency:** 5+ in corpus

---

### M2: Parallel Domain Comparison

**Description:** Take a non-sales domain and map it precisely onto sales concepts. Create parallel lists that show the connection.

**When to use:** After O5 (Extended Metaphor), Surf and Sales content

**Structure:**
```
In [Domain A]:
[Step 1]
[Step 2]
[Step 3]
[Outcome]

In [Domain B]:
[Step 1 parallel]
[Step 2 parallel]
[Step 3 parallel]
[Outcome parallel]
```

**Example (Post 6):**
```
In the water:
See the wave forming
Position yourself
Paddle like hell
Commit fully
Or wipe out, hard

In sales:
See the opportunity
Position your value
Push forward
Close it
Or lose it, hard.
```

**Why it works:** Makes abstract sales concepts visceral through concrete physical metaphor.
**Frequency:** 4+ in corpus

---

### M3: Sequential Framework

**Description:** Establish clear order of operations. Numbering creates authority and memorability.

**When to use:** After O1 (Bold Stat), tactical content, how-to pieces

**Structure:**
```
[Context/why this matters]

[Step/Item] 1: [Name]
[Explanation]
[Application]

[Step/Item] 2: [Name]
[Explanation]
[Application]

[Repeat as needed]
```

**Example (Post 3):**
```
Clarity first. Relationships second. Automation third. That sequence is the competitive advantage.
```

**Example (Post 31):**
```
1. Verify the pain, then Quantify the pain
If there's no pain, there's no deal.
Ask:
What's the real cost of doing nothing?
Is this problem a must-fix or a nice-to-have?
Who else is feeling the pain internally?

2. Confirm the budget
"Yeah, we have a budget for this" means absolutely nothing.
Dig deeper:
Is the budget approved or hypothetical?
Who actually signs the checks?
```

**Why it works:** Numbered steps create actionable takeaways and implicit promise of completeness.
**Frequency:** 6+ in corpus

---

### M4: Pro/Con Analysis

**Description:** Acknowledge both sides of a decision before taking a position. Shows nuance and builds trust.

**When to use:** After O14 (Pro/Con Setup), balanced takes, "it depends" content

**Structure:**
```
The pro? [Benefit of controversial decision]
[Supporting detail]

The con? [Cost of that decision]
[Supporting detail]

[Position or conditional advice]
```

**Example (Post 13):**
```
The pro? You force your company to finally build real demand instead of hiding behind cold outbound. Better ICP clarity. Cleaner messaging. More founder-led selling. Less spray and pray.

The con? You just removed the only team in your company that talks to the market 200 times a week. You lose early signals. You lose pattern recognition. You lose the farm league where future AEs learn the craft.

So should you kill SDRs?

Only if you're ready to replace that learning, that market intel, and that volume with something better... not just cheaper.
```

**Why it works:** Demonstrates you've considered trade-offs. Position feels earned, not dogmatic.
**Frequency:** 3+ in corpus

---

### M5: Formula Contrast

**Description:** Present wrong approach as a "formula" then contrast with right approach. Makes abstract behaviors concrete.

**When to use:** After O8 (Personal Stakes), transformation content, mindset pieces

**Structure:**
```
The [wrong] formula [I/they lived]:
[Step 1]
[Step 2]
[Step 3]
[Negative outcome]

The [right] formula that [worked]:
[Step 1]
[Step 2]
[Step 3]
[Positive outcome]
```

**Example (Post 9):**
```
The overthinking formula I lived:
Research every option
Build contingency plans
Wait for perfect timing
Watch others execute
Repeat from the hospital bed

The action formula that saved me:
Pick 1 thing
Do it today
Fix it tomorrow
Ship it anyway
```

**Why it works:** Personal admission of wrong path creates trust. Parallel structure makes solution memorable.
**Frequency:** 3+ in corpus

---

### M6: Insider Reveal

**Description:** Expose what insiders know that outsiders don't. Creates "us vs. them" dynamic with reader on inside.

**When to use:** After O10 (Industry Call-Out), education content, equity/comp discussions

**Structure:**
```
They say:
[Public narrative 1]
[Public narrative 2]
[Public narrative 3]

They don't say:
[Hidden truth 1]
[Hidden truth 2]
[Hidden truth 3]
[What this actually means]
```

**Example (Post 12):**
```
They say:
"You're getting stock options"
"We're valued at millions"
"You could get rich"

They don't say:
Your strike price vs current valuation
The preference stack ahead of you
How many rounds until you're diluted to nothingness
That most startups exits return less than invested capital
```

**Why it works:** Creates alliance with reader against information asymmetry. Positions you as honest broker.
**Frequency:** 3+ in corpus

---

## Narrative Structures

### M7: Personal Story Arc

**Description:** Tell a complete story with setup, conflict, and resolution. Earns authority through lived experience.

**When to use:** After O8 (Personal Stakes), O9 (Transformation Story), vulnerability pieces

**Structure:**
```
[Stakes/context]
[The struggle/challenge]
[The turning point]
[The lesson/outcome]
[Bridge to prescription]
```

**Example (Post 9):**
```
I had every excuse to wait.
Doctors saying "take it slow."
Body screaming "you're not ready."
0 proof I'd succeed.

Started anyway.

Built my consulting business.
Started coaching.
Wrote books.
Created a platform and a network that brings leads.

Not because I was ready.
Because I was tired of thinking about being ready.
```

**Why it works:** Vulnerability creates connection. Specific details create credibility. Resolution creates hope.
**Frequency:** 4+ in corpus

---

### M8: Transformation Proof

**Description:** Use other people's transformations as evidence. Shows pattern, not just personal anecdote.

**When to use:** After O9 (Transformation Story), hiring philosophy, proof points

**Structure:**
```
[Transformation claim]
[Example 1: Before --> After]
[Example 2: Before --> After]
[What this proves]
```

**Example (Post 10):**
```
Think about what losing everything teaches you:
How to fight when you've got absolutely nothing left.
How to appreciate every single opportunity presented to you.
How to outwork everyone who's just happy to be there who's had it easier.

Think about what real hardship creates:
The ability to read people.
The hunger to never go back.
The resilience that can't be taught in business school.
```

**Why it works:** Multiple examples create pattern. Shows you've seen it work repeatedly.
**Frequency:** 3+ in corpus

---

### M9: Counter-Argument Demolition

**Description:** Anticipate the objection, state it, then destroy it with evidence or reframe.

**When to use:** After O3 (Direct Challenge), O17 (Myth Busting), contrarian takes

**Structure:**
```
[The common objection/belief]
[Why people believe it]
[The evidence/logic that disproves it]
[The reframe]
```

**Example (Post 20):**
```
So why are we still worshipping acquisition like it's the holy grail?

The real growth engine isn't new logos.
It's Customer Success.

Happy customers renew.
Happy customers refer.
Happy customers become your best salespeople.

And yet... most teams still treat CS like an afterthought.
(Meanwhile, they're the ones keeping the lights on.)
```

**Why it works:** Acknowledging opposing view builds credibility. Systematic dismantling feels conclusive.
**Frequency:** 3+ in corpus

---

## List Structures

### M10: Contrast Lists

**Description:** Two parallel lists showing wrong vs. right, fake vs. real, appearance vs. reality.

**When to use:** After O11 (Binary Contrast), O3 (Direct Challenge), comparison content

**Structure:**
```
[Category A]:
[Item 1]
[Item 2]
[Item 3]
[Pattern observation]

[Category B]:
[Item 1]
[Item 2]
[Item 3]
[Pattern observation]
```

**Example (Post 17):**
```
Busy work
Updating a CRM nobody reads
Polishing decks that never get pitched
Sitting in "alignment" meetings with zero alignment
Rewriting a cold email sequence for the 15th time
Slack debates like you're running a presidential campaign
Content calendars and brainstorming sessions you never hit publish on

Looks serious. Feels safe. Builds nothing.

Revenue Work
Calling people who actually have a problem you solve
Getting in front of decision-makers, not "champions"
Dropping into DMs with a pulse, not a template
Asking uncomfortable questions early
Unlocking urgency instead of begging for timelines
Sending a contract instead of "checking in"

It's uncomfortable. It exposes you. It also moves money every single time.
```

**Why it works:** Parallel structure makes comparison undeniable. Specific items prevent vague agreement.
**Frequency:** 5+ in corpus

---

### M11: Numbered Priority Lists

**Description:** Stack items in priority order. Numbers create authority and implied research.

**When to use:** After O1 (Bold Stat), tactical content, ranking pieces

**Structure:**
```
[Context for ranking]
#1 [Priority item]: [Brief explanation]
#2 [Priority item]: [Brief explanation]
#3 [Priority item]: [Brief explanation]
...
```

**Example (Post 21):**
```
Most important items for sellers to prioritize:
#1 RGA's: Prospecting, Follow Ups, etc.
#2 Network Growth: Events, LinkedIn, in person mtg
#3 Practice: Roleplay, Listening to calls, etc.
#4 Mindset: Exercise, Family, Self Care
#5 Learning: Podcasts, Books, Mentors
```

**Why it works:** Numbering implies hierarchy and completeness. Easy to scan and remember.
**Frequency:** 4+ in corpus

---

### M12: Stacked Questions

**Description:** Present a series of diagnostic questions. Creates interactive feel and reveals expertise.

**When to use:** After O6 (Provocative Question), O10 (Industry Call-Out), education content

**Structure:**
```
[Context/challenge]
Ask:
[Question 1]
[Question 2]
[Question 3]

[What the answers reveal]
```

**Example (Post 31):**
```
2. Confirm the budget
"Yeah, we have a budget for this" means absolutely nothing.
Dig deeper:
Is the budget approved or hypothetical?
Who actually signs the checks?
What did they pay last time for something similar?

If you don't know who controls the money, you don't control the deal.
```

**Why it works:** Questions show expertise through what you know to ask. Reader can immediately apply.
**Frequency:** 4+ in corpus

---

### M13: Arrow/Bullet Cascade

**Description:** Use arrows or symbols to create visual flow of consequences or components.

**When to use:** After O3 (Direct Challenge), showing cause/effect, leadership content

**Structure:**
```
[Setup statement]
-> [Consequence/component 1]
-> [Consequence/component 2]
-> [Consequence/component 3]
[Summary observation]
```

**Example (Post 26):**
```
Here's what that costs you:
-> Trust falls apart.
-> People stop speaking up.
-> You miss the real problems.
-> Nobody's learning how to lead.
```

**Why it works:** Visual markers guide the eye. Creates sense of accumulating impact.
**Frequency:** 4+ in corpus

---

## Evidence Patterns

### M14: Credential Stack

**Description:** Rapidly stack credentials to establish authority before making a claim.

**When to use:** After O7 (Credential + Contrarian), when authority matters for the take to land

**Structure:**
```
[Credential 1]. [Credential 2]. [Credential 3].
[Claim this qualifies you to make]
```

**Example (Post 23):**
```
I've been part of 12 unicorns and 15 exits over 20 years. I've built sales orgs from zero to eight figures six times.

The companies that win aren't just doing traditional outbound anymore.
```

**Why it works:** Numbers create specificity. Stacking prevents dismissal as lightweight.
**Frequency:** 3+ in corpus

---

### M15: Specific Detail Proof

**Description:** Use hyper-specific numbers, dates, or details to create credibility through precision.

**When to use:** After O8 (Personal Stakes), transformation stories, proof points

**Structure:**
```
[Claim]
[Specific detail 1]
[Specific detail 2]
[Specific detail 3]
[What this proves]
```

**Example (Post 9):**
```
4 years. 9 surgeries. 1 addiction kicked. That's what it took before I could even start a career in sales.
```

**Example (Post 1):**
```
Company: Donut Press Media
Comp: $40k-$50k base / $80k-$100k OTE / 10 bps
Location: Anywhere USA (Austin ideal)
```

**Why it works:** Specificity signals truth. Vague claims can be made up; specific ones require experience.
**Frequency:** 6+ in corpus

---

### M16: "Ask Them About..." Reveal

**Description:** Provide a specific question that will expose the difference between real and fake.

**When to use:** After M1 (Contrarian Evidence Stack), exposing pretenders, hiring advice

**Structure:**
```
[How to spot the difference]
Ask them about [specific topic].
[What real ones say]
[What fake ones say]
```

**Example (Post 8):**
```
Want to spot the difference?
Ask them about their biggest failure.

Real leaders tell you exactly what it cost, professionally and personally.
Who had to be let go.
What they'd do differently.
Why it cost them so much more than they expected.

Influencers?
They've "never really failed, just learned lessons."
```

**Why it works:** Gives reader an actionable test. Demonstrates your pattern recognition.
**Frequency:** 2+ in corpus

---

## Transition Techniques

### T1: Pivot Markers

**Description:** Short phrases that signal a shift in direction or energy.

**Examples:**
- "Let me tell you what I mean."
- "Here's the thing..."
- "But here's what changes:"
- "And yet..."
- "So why are we still..."
- "Here's what that costs you:"
- "Now when I..."
- "That's not [X]. That's [Y]."

**When to use:** Between sections, before the main point, after setup

---

### T2: Direct Address Shifts

**Description:** Shift from abstract to speaking directly to reader.

**Examples:**
- "Look at your calendar. If most of what you're doing could be done by a polite intern with a laptop and a latte, you're in busy-work mode."
- "That proposal you're perfecting right now? Send it. That hire you're analyzing? Make the call."
- "If you lead people, read this twice."

**When to use:** Moving from analysis to prescription, creating urgency

---

### T3: Question Pivots

**Description:** Use a question to pivot from problem to solution or from theory to application.

**Examples:**
- "So should you kill SDRs?"
- "Do you want to look productive or be dangerous?"
- "You know what's harder?"

**When to use:** Between sections, before revealing answer, creating curiosity

---

### T4: "Meanwhile" Contrast

**Description:** Show what others are doing while the point unfolds.

**Examples:**
- "Meanwhile, their competitors just called those customers."
- "Meanwhile, they're the ones keeping the lights on."
- "And they wonder why their best people bounce."

**When to use:** After describing wrong behavior, creating contrast

---

## Energy Matching Guide

| Opening Type | Best Middle Structures | Avoid |
|-------------|------------------------|-------|
| O1 (Bold Stat) | M3 (Sequential), M11 (Numbered) | M7 (Story arc too slow) |
| O3 (Direct Challenge) | M1 (Contrarian Evidence), M10 (Contrast Lists) | M4 (Pro/Con too balanced) |
| O4 (Pithy Truth) | Brief elaboration or standalone | Any long structure |
| O5 (Extended Metaphor) | M2 (Parallel Domain) | M11 (Numbered kills metaphor) |
| O6 (Provocative Question) | M9 (Counter-Argument), M3 (Sequential) | M7 (Story delays answer) |
| O7 (Credential + Contrarian) | M14 (Credential Stack), M1 (Evidence) | M5 (Formula too personal) |
| O8 (Personal Stakes) | M7 (Story Arc), M5 (Formula Contrast) | M11 (Numbered too impersonal) |
| O9 (Transformation Story) | M8 (Transformation Proof), M7 (Story) | M14 (Credential feels like bragging) |
| O10 (Industry Call-Out) | M6 (Insider Reveal), M12 (Stacked Questions) | M4 (Pro/Con too forgiving) |
| O11 (Binary Contrast) | M10 (Contrast Lists), M5 (Formula) | M3 (Sequential too linear) |
| O14 (Pro/Con Setup) | M4 (Pro/Con Analysis), M9 (Counter-Argument) | M1 (Too one-sided) |
| O17 (Myth Busting) | M9 (Counter-Argument), M6 (Insider Reveal) | M4 (Pro/Con undermines myth-bust) |
| O24 (Stop/Start) | Brief elaboration, M10 (Contrast Lists) | Long structures |

---

## Middle Lengths

### Short (2-4 sentences)
For: O4 (Pithy Truth), O18 (Repeat After Me), O24 (Stop/Start), quick wisdom
**Pattern:** Opening IS the middle. Brief elaboration or standalone.

### Medium (1-2 paragraphs)
For: O1 (Bold Stat), O6 (Provocative Question), O11 (Binary Contrast)
**Pattern:** Single middle structure (one list, one comparison, one proof point)

### Long (3+ paragraphs)
For: O8 (Personal Stakes), O7 (Credential + Contrarian), O10 (Industry Call-Out)
**Pattern:** Multiple middle structures combined (story + evidence + prescription)

---

## Tensions (Generation Guidance)

### Story vs. Framework Balance
**Issue:** Long stories can lose momentum. Pure frameworks can feel cold.
**Rule:** Alternate. If opening is story, middle should have tactical element. If opening is framework, middle should have human proof.

### List Fatigue
**Issue:** Stacking too many lists exhausts the reader.
**Rule:** Maximum 2 list structures per post. If you have a contrast list, don't also have a numbered list immediately after.

### Credential Bragging
**Issue:** M14 (Credential Stack) can feel like bragging if overdone.
**Rule:** Stack credentials only when the contrarian claim needs authority to land. Use sparingly. Never more than 2 sentences.

### Specificity vs. Privacy
**Issue:** M15 (Specific Detail Proof) requires real details.
**Rule:** Use specific numbers for business metrics (12 unicorns, 15 exits). Keep personal details bounded (family names in STORIES only, not casual mentions).

---

## === Rationale ===

### Classification Decisions

**Middle vs. Opening:**
- **Opening:** First 1-2 lines that hook attention
- **Middle:** Everything between opening hook and closing CTA/wisdom

**Middle vs. Voice:**
- **Voice:** Sentence-level mechanics (punctuation, rhythm, vocabulary)
- **Middle:** Paragraph-level structure (argument flow, evidence organization)

**Middle vs. Blend:**
- **Middle:** Individual structural patterns (M1, M2, etc.)
- **Blend:** How openings + middles + endings combine into content archetypes

### Material Routed Elsewhere

| Item | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| CTA patterns | ENDINGS.md |
| Signature phrases used in middles | VOICE.md |
| Content archetypes (how patterns combine) | BLENDS.md |
| Full story arcs (Diagnosis, First Sale, etc.) | STORIES.md |
| Surfing metaphor system | ANECDOTES.md |

### Confidence Levels

| Pattern | Confidence | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| M1 (Contrarian Evidence) | High | 5+ examples |
| M2 (Parallel Domain) | High | 4+ examples |
| M3 (Sequential Framework) | High | 6+ examples |
