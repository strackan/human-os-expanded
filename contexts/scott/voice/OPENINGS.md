# OPENINGS

## How to Use Openings

Openings serve one purpose: **Stop the scroll.**

The first 1-2 lines determine whether anyone reads the rest. Scott's openings:
- **Hook** - Create immediate tension, curiosity, or recognition
- **Signal** - Tell the reader what kind of content this is (tactical, story, rant, etc.)
- **Promise** - Imply value worth the reading time

**Usage Rule:** Match opening energy to content type. A vulnerable story needs different entry than a contrarian rant.

## Transcript-Derived Patterns (Experimental)

These patterns come from how Scott opens topics in spoken conversation. They're more raw and could bring authenticity to written content.

### T1: Candid Confession

**Description:** Signal honesty by admitting you're about to be unusually direct.

**Spoken Example:**
> "To be perfectly candid with you, it's not usually the sales team that has this problem."

**Written Adaptation:**
> "I'll be candid: most sales leaders won't tell you this, but..."

**Why it works:** Signals insider knowledge and vulnerability simultaneously.

---

### T2: Truth Bomb Setup

**Description:** Frame what you're about to say as something others hide.

**Spoken Example:**
> "The truth bomb that most VPs of Sales probably will lie about... 'We don't know.'"

**Written Adaptation:**
> "Here's the truth most sales leaders won't admit: we're guessing."

**Why it works:** Creates trust through admitted uncertainty.

---

### T3: Direct Bullshit Call

**Description:** Explicitly call out something as wrong using strong language.

**Spoken Example:**
> "I hear people say, 'Humans will always want to buy from humans,' and I say, well, that's bullshit."

**Written Adaptation:**
> "Humans will always want to buy from humans? That's bullshit."

**Why it works:** Provocative and memorable. Use sparingly on LinkedIn.

---

### T4: Rhetorical Flip

**Description:** Ask a question that seems to have obvious answer, then flip it.

**Spoken Example:**
> "Can you imagine making 50% of your sales? You'd be an absolute hero. You'd be a legend, right? Nope, it doesn't work that way."

**Written Adaptation:**
> "What if you closed 50% of your deals? You'd be a legend. Except... you'd still miss quota."

**Why it works:** Reframes expectations through contrast.

---

### T5: Humility Hook

**Description:** Open with admission of universal uncertainty, then offer perspective anyway.

**Spoken Example:**
> "Honestly, if anyone had this figured out perfectly, we wouldn't be working anymore. Nobody has this figured out--nobody."

**Written Adaptation:**
> "Nobody has hiring figured out. Nobody. I've hired and fired thousands, and I'm telling you: it's really freaking hard."

**Why it works:** Builds trust through honest struggle, not false confidence.

---

### T6: Hell and Back

**Description:** Reference personal hardship as credibility for current advice.

**Spoken Example:**
> "I have been through Hell and back in my life, and I think the smartest thing that I did a long time ago was just to own it."

**Written Adaptation:**
> "I've been through hell and back. That's not a metaphor. And here's what it taught me about [topic]."

**Why it works:** Vulnerability creates connection; earned perspective creates authority.

## Energy Matching Guide

| Content Type | Best Openings | Avoid |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Quick wisdom drop | O4 (Pithy Truth), O24 (Stop/Start) | O5, O8 (too long) |
| Contrarian take | O3, O6, O13, O17 (Myth Busting) | O4 (not enough setup) |
| Personal story | O8, O9, T6, O21 (They Laughed) | O1 (too analytical) |
| Framework/tactical | O1, O7, O22 (Most People Don't) | O8 (wrong energy) |
| Industry rant | O3, O10, T3, O19 (Combustion) | O4 (not enough heat) |
| Surf and Sales | O5, O2 | O1 (wrong vibe) |
| Vulnerability piece | O8, T1, T5 | O3 (too aggressive) |
| Solopreneur content | O15 (Year-Based), O18 (Repeat After Me) | O7 (wrong audience) |
| Leadership call-out | O16 (Accusatory), O3 | O4 (not enough force) |
| Mindset/motivation | O18 (Repeat After Me), O4 | O1 (too analytical) |
| Pet peeve content | O19 (Combustion), O3 | O8 (wrong energy) |
| Observation/trend | O23 (Just Spoke With), O1 | O8 (too personal) |

## Opening Combinations

Some posts use layered openings. First line hooks, second line sets up.

**Stat + Challenge:**
> "67% of SaaS sales teams will miss quota this year. And most founders still think the solution is more cold calls."

**Question + Answer:**
> "The smartest thing dumb salespeople ever did? Hire smart people to make them look smarter."

**Stakes + Redirect:**
> "4 years. 9 surgeries. 1 addiction kicked. That's what it took before I could even start a career in sales."

---

## Tensions (Generation Guidance)

### Profanity in Openings
**LinkedIn:** Keep clean. "That's bullshit" is about as far as it goes (and rarely).
**Rule:** T3 (Direct Bullshit Call) should be rare on LinkedIn. Save for high-conviction contrarian takes.

### Personal Stakes Frequency
**Issue:** O8 opens with vulnerability. Overuse dilutes impact.
**Rule:** Use sparingly. Not every post needs the hospital. Reserve for pieces where the personal stakes genuinely support the point.

### Pithy vs. Setup
**Issue:** O4 (Pithy Truth) works alone. Other openings need follow-through.
**Rule:** If opening promises depth (O10, O7), deliver it. Don't tease industry secrets and give surface advice.

---

## === Rationale ===

### Classification Decisions

**Opening vs. Signature Phrase:**
- **Opening:** First-line pattern that hooks attention. "4 years. 9 surgeries. 1 addiction kicked."
- **Signature Phrase:** Repeatable line used anywhere in content. "Nothing will ever be that hard again."

**LinkedIn vs. Transcript Patterns:**
We created a separate section for transcript-derived patterns (T1-T6) because:
1. They're not yet proven in written form
2. They could be experimental content enhancements
3. They capture authentic verbal tics that might translate well

### Material Routed Elsewhere

| Item | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| CTA/ending patterns | ENDINGS.md |
| Middle structure patterns | MIDDLES.md |
| Content archetypes (how opening + middle + ending combine) | BLENDS.md |
| Signature phrases used in openings | VOICE.md |

### Confidence Levels

| Pattern | Confidence | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| O1-O4 (Bold stat, Contrarian, Challenge, Pithy) | High | 4+ examples each |
| O5-O10 (Metaphor through Call-out) | High | 2-4 examples each |
| O11-O14 (Binary, Urgency, Dismissive, Pro/Con) | Medium-High | 2+ examples each |
| O15-O18 (Year-Based, Accusatory, Myth, Repeat) | Medium-High | 2-3 examples each |
| O19-O24 (Combustion through Stop/Start) | Medium-High | 2-5 examples each |
| T1-T6 (Transcript patterns) | Medium | Spoken, not yet written-proven |
