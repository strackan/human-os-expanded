## === Open Questions for Sculptor ===

### Example Validation

1. **Best Representations?**
   Are these the posts Scott would choose as best examples of each blend? Any favorites we missed?

2. **Engagement Correlation?**
   Do the selected examples correlate with highest engagement posts? Should engagement data influence selection?

3. **Recency Preference?**
   Should we prefer more recent examples over older ones, even if older ones are cleaner executions?

### Example Gaps

4. **Newsletter Examples?**
   All examples are LinkedIn. Should we add newsletter examples for comparison?

5. **Podcast Episode Examples?**
   Should we include podcast episode structures as examples?

6. **B7 (Pithy Wisdom) Depth?**
   We included 3 pithy examples. Is this enough given it's the most common format?

### Anti-Example Needs

7. **Real Anti-Examples?**
   We constructed anti-examples. Are there real posts that failed and could serve as "what not to do"?

8. **More Energy Mismatches?**
   Should we show more anti-blend combinations with explanations?

### Platform Adaptation

9. **Instagram/TikTok Examples?**
   If Scott posts on other platforms, should we include examples showing adaptation?

10. **Thread/Carousel Format?**
    Should we show examples of multi-post content structures?
