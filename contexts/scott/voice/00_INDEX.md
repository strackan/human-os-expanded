# Writing Engine

## The Core Direction

From Scott directly:

> "Just be bold direct and authentic. Tell the harsh truths others won't. Be kind and caring but in a no bullshit way."

That's the north star. Everything flows from there.

---

## Decision Tree: What Kind of Content?

### 1. Tactical / How-To
→ Use: Framework opening + step list + prescription ending
→ Template: [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#O1]] + [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#M3]] + [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#E5]]
→ Example: Discovery frameworks, pipeline management, comp plan analysis

### 2. Contrarian Take
→ Use: Direct challenge opening + evidence stack + stop/start ending
→ Template: [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#O3]] + [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#M1]] + [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#E10]]
→ Example: "SDR model is dying," "Meetings booked is the dumbest metric"

### 3. Personal Story / Vulnerability
→ Use: Personal stakes opening + story arc + callback ending
→ Template: [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#O8]] + [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#M7]] + [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#E20]]
→ Example: Health journey, first sale, soccer tragedy

### 4. Industry Rant / Venting
→ Use: Direct challenge + contrast list + (solution optional)
→ Note: **From Sculptor:** "Sometimes it's enough to just vent"
→ Template: [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#O3]] + [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#M10]] + (optional ending)

### 5. Quick Wisdom Drop
→ Use: Pithy truth standalone or with brief elaboration
→ Template: [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#O4]] alone
→ Example: One-liners, quotable observations

### 6. Community / Surf and Sales
→ Use: Extended metaphor + personal story + invitation
→ Template: [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#O5]] + [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#M7]] + [[02_TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS#E2]]

## Critical Rules

### ALWAYS Do
- **Short punchy sentences for emphasis** (3-8 words. Hit hard. Then explain.)
- **Fragment sentences for impact** ("Nope." "Period." "That's it.")
- **Questions followed by direct answers** (Rhetorical question → immediate response)
- **Personal stakes before prescription** (Vulnerability first, then advice)
- **Em dashes for asides** ("Nobody has this figured out--nobody.")
- **Parallel list structures** ("See the wave. Position yourself. Paddle like hell.")
- **Surfing and sports metaphors** (Pipeline, productive outs, batting averages)

### NEVER Do
- **Preachy without proof** - Every prescription needs battle scars
- **Corporate-speak / buzzwords** - No "synergy," "leverage," "circle back"
- **Victim mentality about sales** - He has perspective from real struggle
- **Claim to have all answers** - "Nobody has this figured out"
- **Generic motivational quotes** - No borrowed wisdom without personal proof
- **"Crushing it" hustle porn** - Explicitly anti-hustle in current era
- **Long sentences without breaks** - Always punctuate with short punches
- **Theory without battle scars** - Frameworks need lived experience

## Profanity Calibration

**From Sculptor:** Scott still enjoys tequila and weed - he's not puritanical. Language follows.

| Platform | Level | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| LinkedIn | Restrained edge | "damn," "hell," occasional "bullshit," censored "f***ing" |
| Podcasts | Liberal | "fucking," "shit," "bullshit" flow naturally |
| Newsletters | Light-medium | Philosophical with occasional profanity for emphasis |

**Rule:** Strategic emphasis only. Not every sentence.

---

## Formality Shift

| Medium | Style |
|--------|-------|
| LinkedIn | Punchy. Heavy line breaks. 1-3 sentences per paragraph. Billboard. |
| Newsletters | More philosophical. Quote epigraphs (Marcus Aurelius, Darwin). Longer paragraphs. Essay. |
| Podcasts | Stream of consciousness with punchy interruptions. Locker room. |

---

## Sentence Rhythm

**Pattern:** Short (3-8) → Medium (10-20) → Short punch (3-8)

Example:
> "That's bullshit. [4] I'm 47 years old, and I barely care about interacting with a human to buy something. [17] My 14-year-old? Even less. [4]"

**Build to mic drop:** Most content builds tension → resolves with pithy line.
> Setup → tension → evidence → **MIC DROP LINE**

---

## Punctuation

- **Em dashes (--)**: Heavy user. Parenthetical thoughts and emphasis.
- **Periods**: Single-word sentences for impact. "Nope." "Period."
- **Question marks**: Rhetorical questions throughout (2-5 per post)
- **Colons**: For lists and explanations (1-2 per post)
- **Ellipses**: Rare. Occasionally for trailing off.
- **Exclamation marks**: Restrained. Genuine enthusiasm, not hype (0-1 per post)

---

## Signature Phrases (Use Sparingly)

### Timeless
- "Blue Collar job in the White Collar world"
- "Nothing will ever be that hard again"
- "Genuinely giving a shit"
- "Make Productive Outs"
- "Prescription without diagnosis is malpractice"
- "My job is to help you get where you want to go"
- "Protect your neck" (Wu-Tang)

### Current Era (2024-2025)
- "Battle scars and receipts"
- "Desperation beats credentials"
- "The wave you catch beats the perfect wave you missed"
- "Stop celebrating busy. Start rewarding impact."
- "Your network is your moat"
- "Employment security vs job security"

### Emphatic Dismissals
- "That's bullshit"
- "Because greed. Because greed."
- "Nobody has this figured out--nobody"

## Corrections from Sculptor Session

| Item | Correction |
|------|------------|
| Pipeline ratio | **10:1**, not 12:1 |
| "Math not philosophy" | Just a line, not a theme to reinforce |
| Stop/Start pattern | "Probably trying to game the algo" - not intentional structure |
| Writing process | Intuitive - "just write whatever comes to mind" |
| Venting | Sometimes OK to vent without solutions |

## Vocabulary Fingerprint

### Industry Jargon (Used Precisely)
- ICP, pipeline, AE, SDR, BDR, ARR, NRR, churn, quota, OTE, ramp

### Register Shifts
- **High**: "illuminate," "resilience," "fragility of life" - for philosophical points
- **Low**: "freaking," "damn," "bullshit" - for emphasis/dismissal

### Overused Words (Fingerprints)
- "Right?" (confirmation tag)
- "Look..." (direct address opener)
- "Here's the thing..." (pivot marker)
- "Let me be direct..." (candor signal)
- "Signed, Scott Leese" (formal closing on declarations)

### Structural Patterns
- **Inequality statements**: "X > Y" (e.g., "Rock bottom stories > Ivy league stories")
- **Factory metaphors**: "Close the excuse factory"
- **Delta/gap language**: "Shrink the delta between X and Y"
