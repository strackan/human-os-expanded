# OPENINGS.md Synthesis Summary

## What Was Built
- 14 Core Opening Patterns (O1-O14) from LinkedIn corpus
- 6 Transcript-Derived Patterns (T1-T6) as experimental additions
- Energy Matching Guide for content type alignment
- Opening Combinations section (layered hooks)
- 3 Tensions documented

## Queued Items Received

| From | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| VOICE_SUMMARY.md | Opening hook patterns (10 types) | Captured + expanded to 14 |
| STORIES_SUMMARY.md | How to open with story (patterns) | Captured as O8 (Personal Stakes), O9 (Transformation) |
| ANECDOTES_SUMMARY.md | How to open with anecdote or metaphor | Captured as O5 (Extended Metaphor) |

## Source Prioritization

| Tier | Weight | Sources |
|------|--------|---------|
| Primary | Highest | linkedin-posts-2025-12.md (50 posts, direct examples) |
| Secondary | High | Voice Analysis Notes (pre-extracted 10 patterns) |
| Experimental | Medium | Podcast transcripts (raw spoken hooks for adaptation) |

## Innovation: Transcript-Derived Patterns

Per user guidance, we mined podcast transcripts for authentic spoken patterns that could enhance written content. These are flagged as **experimental** because:
- They're proven in conversation, not writing
- They could add authenticity if adapted well
- They represent "unscripted Scott" that might resonate differently

Examples:
- **T2 (Truth Bomb Setup):** "The truth bomb that most VPs of Sales probably will lie about... We don't know."
- **T5 (Humility Hook):** "Nobody has this figured out--nobody."

## 50/50 Calls Made

### 1. How Many Core Patterns?
**Decision:** 14 core patterns (expanded from Voice Analysis Notes' 10)
**Rationale:** Found 4 additional patterns not in original extraction: Binary Contrast, Urgency Frame, Dismissive Setup, Pro/Con Setup. All had 2+ examples.
**Confidence:** High

### 2. Transcript Patterns: Include or Exclude?
**Decision:** Include as separate "Experimental" section
**Rationale:** User explicitly requested mining transcripts for authentic patterns. Keeping separate acknowledges they're unproven in written form while preserving the insight.
**Confidence:** High (on decision to include; Medium on patterns themselves)

### 3. O4 (Pithy Truth): Opening or Standalone?
**Decision:** Opening pattern (can stand alone OR lead content)
**Rationale:** Many 1-2 sentence posts use this as complete content. But it also functions as hook for longer pieces.
**Confidence:** High

### 4. Personal Stakes Frequency Guidance?
**Decision:** Added tension noting overuse risk
**Rationale:** O8 (Personal Stakes) is powerful but could become formulaic if every post opens with hospital reference.
**Confidence:** Medium-High

### 5. Profanity in Openings?
**Decision:** Documented as tension; recommend rare use on LinkedIn
**Rationale:** T3 (Direct Bullshit Call) works in podcasts but LinkedIn audience is different. "That's bullshit" appears rarely in LinkedIn corpus.
**Confidence:** High

### 6. Energy Matching: Prescriptive or Suggestive?
**Decision:** Created guide table, not hard rules
**Rationale:** Opening choice is contextual. Table suggests best matches without being rigid.
**Confidence:** Medium-High

## === Open Questions for Sculptor ===

### Pattern Validation

1. **Transcript Patterns Worth Testing?**
   We identified 6 spoken patterns (T1-T6) that could translate to writing. Worth experimenting with these, or stick to proven LinkedIn patterns?

2. **Missing Openings?**
   Are there opening patterns Scott uses that we didn't capture? Particularly interested in openings for event promotion, podcast teasers, or community content.

3. **O4 (Pithy Truth) Frequency**
   This appears most often in corpus. Is this intentional strategy (high engagement) or just easier to write?

### Energy & Tone

4. **Vulnerability Frequency**
   O8 (Personal Stakes) and T6 (Hell and Back) both lean on health journey. How often is too often to reference this?

5. **Profanity Threshold**
   T3 (Direct Bullshit Call) is authentic Scott but rare on LinkedIn. What's the threshold for when this is appropriate?

6. **Contrarian vs. Constructive**
   O3 (Direct Challenge) and O13 (Dismissive Setup) have confrontational energy. Balance preference between calling out vs. building up?

### Combinations

7. **Layered Openings**
   Some posts stack patterns (Stat + Challenge). Is this intentional, or does simpler = better?

8. **Opening Length**
   O5 (Extended Metaphor) runs longer. Preference for punchy (O4) vs. immersive (O5)?
