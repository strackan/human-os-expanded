## How to Use Blends

Blends are **proven recipes** -- combinations of Opening + Middle + Ending that work together.

**Why Blends Matter:**
- Not all combinations work. These do.
- Reduce decision fatigue. Pick a blend, fill in content.
- Ensure structural coherence from hook to close.

**Selection Process:**
1. What's your content goal? (educate, challenge, inspire, promote)
2. What's your energy? (vulnerable, punchy, reflective, provocative)
3. Pick blend that matches
4. Fill in with your specific content
5. Adjust components if needed (see Variations)

## Anti-Blends (What Doesn't Work)

Combinations to avoid.

| Combination | Why It Fails |
|-------------|--------------|
| O8 (Personal Stakes) + E1 (Direct CTA) | Vulnerability undercut by sales ask |
| O4 (Pithy Truth) + M3 (Sequential Framework) | Promise doesn't match delivery |
| O5 (Extended Metaphor) + E10 (Stop/Start) | Prescription breaks metaphor spell |
| O10 (Industry Exposé) + E9 (Connection Beyond) | Wrong energy--exposé needs edge |
| O3 (Direct Challenge) + E22 (Engagement Question) | Challenge then open question feels unfinished |
| O9 (Transformation) + E14 (Binary Question) | Story needs resolution, not question |
| Any O# + M# mismatch in length | Long middle after short opening feels padded |

---

## Blend Selection Guide

| Content Goal | Energy | Recommended Blend |
|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| Call out broken practices | Confrontational | B1: Contrarian Takedown |
| Prove counterintuitive claim | Inspirational | B2: Transformation Proof |
| Build credibility through vulnerability | Vulnerable --> Authoritative | B3: Stakes to Prescription |
| Teach through analogy | Reflective | B4: Extended Metaphor |
| Deliver tactical framework | Authoritative | B5: Framework Teaching |
| Expose hidden truths | Insider | B6: Industry Exposé |

## Tensions (Generation Guidance)

### Blend Rigidity
**Issue:** Blends are recipes, not straitjackets.
**Rule:** Use blends as starting points. Swap components from Variations when needed. The goal is coherence, not formula.

### Frequency Mixing
**Issue:** Using same blend repeatedly gets predictable.
**Rule:** Rotate through blends. B7 (Pithy Wisdom) for volume, other blends for depth. Mix energy types.

### Opening-Middle Length Match
**Issue:** Short opening (O4) with long middle feels padded. Long opening (O8) with no middle feels rushed.
**Rule:** Match investment. Short opening = short or no middle. Long opening = developed middle.

### Ending Weight
**Issue:** Compound endings (E10 + E7) work for long posts. Overkill for short posts.
**Rule:** B7 (Pithy) = single-line ending. B1, B3, B9 (long) = compound ending acceptable.

### Story Callback Requirement
**Issue:** E20 (Story Callback) only works if O8 (Personal Stakes) opened with story.
**Rule:** Don't use story callback ending without story opening. Otherwise feels forced.

---

## === Rationale ===

### Classification Decisions

**Blend vs. One-Off:**
- **Blend:** Combination that appears 3+ times OR serves a distinct content purpose (Job Posting, Event Promo)
- **One-Off:** Unique combination in a single post. May work but not established as pattern.

**Core vs. Specialty:**
- **Core Blends (B1-B10):** General-purpose recipes for common content types
- **Specialty Blends:** Purpose-built for specific content needs (events, jobs, advocacy)

### Material Kept Separate

| Pattern Type | Location |
|--------------|----------|
| Individual openings | OPENINGS.md |
| Individual middles | MIDDLES.md |
| Individual endings | ENDINGS.md |
| Voice mechanics | VOICE.md |
| Full story arcs | STORIES.md |

BLENDS.md shows how O + M + E combine. Individual patterns stay in their respective files.
