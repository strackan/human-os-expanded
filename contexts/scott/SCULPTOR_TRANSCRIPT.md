## Key Clarifications & Corrections

### From Sculptor Session

| Topic | Clarification | Impact |

| **Sobriety** | NOT sober. "I just don't use opioids anymore. Still smoke weed. Still love tequila." | Update THEMES.md - sobriety is NOT an identity marker |
| **Ex-Wife** | Do NOT reference ex-wife at all. Current wife = Janet (need to verify) | Update GUARDRAILS.md |
| **Kids** | Talk about kids in general, not specifics | Update GUARDRAILS.md |
| **Spirituality** | Intentionally absent. Has religious studies degree, hates arguing/debate | Update GUARDRAILS.md - explicitly chosen silence |

| **SDR Position** | Model is dying. Need "salespeople who actually prospect and sell" (full-cycle). AI will eventually replace most salespeople. | Confirms current stance |
| **CS Focus** | "CS is future because it's much harder now to get new customers - better to keep/grow existing" | Clarifies CS vs AI position |
| **Content Style** | "Bold direct and authentic. Tell harsh truths others won't. Kind and caring but no bullshit." | Core voice direction |

## Full Conversation Transcript

### Scene 1: The Lake

**The Sculptor:**

*The lake stretches out before you, glass-still in the dying light. Your fishing line cuts through the water with barely a ripple. The air smells of pine and that particular dampness that comes just before full dark.*

*You turn at the sound of an oar cutting water. A shorter man in a red ball cap is drifting closer in his own boat, his line cast lazily into the same waters. Something about him feels familiar, though you can't place where you might have met him.*

*He looks up from his line and catches your eye.*

"You're Scott Leese?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

Yes i am

---

**The Sculptor:**

*He nods, unsurprised, and reels in his line a bit.*

"You know, I've enjoyed learning about you the last few weeks. But there are a few details that don't quite add up."

*He casts again, the line arcing out into the darkening water.*

"You mind if I clear a few things up?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

fire away

---

### The Health Story (Extended)

**The Sculptor:**

"Alright then. Let's start with the health stuff."

*A loon calls somewhere across the lake.*

"I'm showing 4 years, 9 surgeries, but I'd love to just hear in your own words what that was like for you, and how it changed the way you saw yourself and the world around you."

---

**Scott Leese:**

I should be dead. Not figuratively. Not emotionally. Medically.

The surgeon explained my odds to my parents and the way you'd explain the weather. Neutral. Matter of fact. He almost sounded bored.

And yet, here I am.

Not because I'm special. Not because I'm tougher than you. Not because I cracked some secret system. I'm a normal guy who came from nowhere and who had nothing, went through hell, and was forced to rewire how my brain works just to survive.

Those new pathways, and that rewiring changed everything.

Right before my 23rd birthday, my body turned on itself. No warning. No slow fade. One day I was a normal young guy thinking I was bulletproof and making plans. The next day, I was a patient.

Severe ulcerative colitis. Autoimmune disease. Chronic kidney stones. Colon cancer. Blockages. Then surgery. 9 of them. 4 major emergency abdominal surgeries.

UCSF my residence. IV poles and heart monitors my furniture. Pain became normal.

I spent 4 years in and out of hospitals. 4 years watching other people live while I fought to exist. The hardest part was not the pain. It was the unknown. The waiting.

Waiting to see if the surgery worked. Waiting to see if the medication helped. Waiting to see if my body would betray me again. When you live like this long enough, fear stops being abstract.

It's not a mindset. It's not a thought. It's physical.

So here in America, they introduce you to pain meds. Opioids. At first, it was survival. Then management. Then dependency. I didn't wake up one day and decide to be addicted. My body made that decision for me.

Withdrawal was brutal. Two weeks that felt like my nervous system was on fire. No sleep. Shaking. Sweating. Pain stacked on top of pain. There is nothing heroic about this. Nothing inspiring. It was ugly. And what you learn is this… NOBODY CARES.

The world isn't cruel. It's neutral. It doesn't stop because you're suffering. Time still moves. Life keeps going. People still pay bills, go to work, get married, have kids and live loudly. Just not you. Now that realization can break you, or it can set you free.

One night you may find yourself laying in a hospital bed memorizing the fluorescent lights and popcorn ceiling patterns asking yourself a simple question: "What's the worst thing that could happen?"

And you may follow that up with a second, equally powerful question: "Is it worse than what I've already survived?" Odds are, the answer is no. And in that moment, fear loses credibility and control.

Fear of rejection. Fear of failure. Fear of embarrassment. Fear of starting over. Fear of speaking in front of 12,000 people. None of it compares to being stuck in the hospital wondering if your mind, body and soul are done fighting. And that is perspective.

Perspective doesn't negotiate with fear. Not because you suddenly feel brave. Not because you suddenly feel motivated. Simply because fear doesn't make sense anymore.

What does make sense? The gifts that trauma provides you. Urgency. Not hustle. Not grind. Urgency. When you've spent days, weeks, months and even years waiting on test results, you stop procrastinating. When you've watched time disappear, you stop assuming tomorrow is guaranteed. When pain is constant, clarity gets loud. Real loud.

So I stopped asking: "What if this doesn't work?" And started asking: "Why not try? You've already defeated the hardest thing you will ever face in your life. What is there to worry about and what the hell are you waiting for?"

I decided sales could change my life. Not because it was easy. Because it was honest. You show up. You get told no. You learn. You adjust. You go again. Results don't lie. Leadership came next. Then entrepreneurship. Every risk people warned me about felt small and meaningless. I'd already survived worse.

I want to be very clear about something. The pain doesn't go away for some of us. I still live in pain. Every single day. This is not a story about the absence or disappearance of pain. It's a story about pain losing its authority and control. Pain is ever present. It's just no longer in charge.

I don't wait to feel confident to move. I don't wait to feel ready to act. I don't wait for perfect conditions. I do it anyway. And I try to shrink the delta between idea and action as often as I can. Because I already survived something harder. Because I know how rare each and every opportunity we have in this life is.

Every one of you in the audience should hear me when I say: Everyone can do this.

Not everyone has my diagnosis. Not everyone has my scars. Not everyone has my story. But everyone here has probably been through something that should have stopped them dead in their tracks and would seem impossible to the rest of us to get through. But they did.

Something rewired them without permission. Something painful enough that it could either become an anchor or an engine. Most people turn it into an anchor. They use it as an excuse to explain why they play small. Why they hesitate. Why they wait. But you can close the excuse factory and you can choose to use your trauma as an engine. To use as evidence that you are meant for something more.

Evidence that fear exaggerates and lies. Evidence that discomfort isn't danger. Evidence that action is available to you even when the conditions are less than ideal.

Trauma doesn't make you strong. It gives you raw material. What you build with it is your choice. A choice we all face. Because none of us escape this life without trauma of some type. You can choose to let it shrink your life. Or you can let it permanently lower the cost of courage.

If you are out there living scared right now, ask yourself this one grounding question once again: "What have you already survived that should have ended you…but didn't?" So why are you acting like this next thing, this next step in your journey is the thing that finally will?

I should be dead. So what. I live in pain every day. So what. Nobody cares. Which means I don't need permission. I don't need guarantees. I don't need perfect timing. I just need to take action. I need to move forward. And so do you.

### The First Sale

**The Sculptor:**

"Okay, the Hawaii Friday night story -- any details before the phone call or after your wife says 'if you don't do this, what are you going to do?' That's all the details I have, but anything else you want to throw in there?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

It was 9pm PST. I had ordered beer and pizza for myself. Cold calling Hawaii to take advantage of the time zone change. I was convinced I would be fired if I didnt close a deal.

---

**The Sculptor:**

"So you're having dinner and drinks, calling Hawaii at what - 6 PM their time? That's actually smart timing. Still, beer and pizza, convinced you're about to get fired if you don't close this deal... What was going through your head when you dialed? And after your wife said 'if you don't do this, what are you going to do?' - what happened next in that conversation?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

a mix of desperation and determination i suppose. after my wife at the time - now ex wife - said that to me i just remember feeling like damn shes right. you have no other options. its this or nothing.

---

**The Sculptor:**

"'It's this or nothing.' That's a hell of a place to make a call from."

---

**Scott Leese:**

all i remember is it was a one call close

---

### The Soccer Tragedy

**The Sculptor:**

"Okay, the soccer tragedy -- how much detail is okay to use? For example, is the teammate's name something you share publicly? What about the score, timing, those details?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

every detail is ok to use.

basically i had to choose between going home to teammate and friends funeral or stay and play in my first ever college soccer game. i chose to stay and play. we were the underdog against a national ranked team and we were up 1-0 in the final minutes and I got called for a foul which gave the other team a penalty kick and they tied it up. i got heckled. a minute or so later i kicked in the winning goal from 30 yards out. just a cool story

---

**The Sculptor:**

"How do you carry something like that? Making a choice between honoring the dead and chasing your dreams, then having both the lowest and highest moment of the game rest on your shoulders?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

you know i think it told me that i can make hard decisions and the correct ones. it taught me not to get too low nor too high - to stay steady.

---

### Scene 2: The Frogs

**The Sculptor:**

"Did I ever tell you I was married? My wife was a real battle axe. But we're both a lot happier now."

"But enough about me. I've noticed there's some stuff that sort of ebbs and flows in your content, and I want to get the story straight. First off -- sobriety. Is that still something that's an identity marker for you? Should I keep bringing it up, or... maybe not so much right now?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

nah its not a marker because im not sober. i just dont use opioids anymore. still smoke weed. still love tequila.

---

### Family

**The Sculptor:**

"I see you reference your wife in prior posts. Is she someone you still want to reference? I rarely see your kids. Is that coincidental, or intentional? Family stays out of the story?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

i do not want to reference my now ex-wife at all really. i talk about my kids in general just not specifics

---

### Spirituality

**The Sculptor:**

"Speaking of, I've noticed you never mention spirituality -- like not even 'the universe' or some new-agey thing. Intentional, or just not something you think much about?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

intentional. because i have a religious studies degree.

---

**The Sculptor:**

"Religious studies degree, huh? That's... that's not what I was expecting. So you know all the theology, all the different traditions, and you choose to keep it out of your content completely."

---

**Scott Leese:**

correct. i dont feel like arguing. in fact i hate arguing. hate debate. so i just say nothing on religion, politics etc.

---

### Surf and Sales Origin

**The Sculptor:**

"Surf and Sales. That's one of Justin's favorite things about you. How did it start? Was there a specific moment?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

We started The Surf & Sales Summit because bigger is not always better.

We wanted to create an opportunity for sales professionals to learn and grow, while being able to fully disconnect in a beautiful and inspiring location with like-minded peers. We were confident our guests would value the training and coaching we offered, but the impact Surf & Sales has had on our guests, and on us, has exceeded our wildest expectations.

What has surprised us the most is how many attendees have had a much deeper, more meaningful experience. Many have been inspired to make a big leap in their career, or face a painful challenge that was holding them back. Story after story rolled in of how they have used this opportunity, and the supportive, safe environment our events provide, to dig deep and make big moves, in work and in life.

Surf & Sales began as an event. It has become a community - and we all need that, now more than ever.

We still provide fresh, impactful content at every Surf & Sales event, but we've learned that the most valuable thing we can provide is you. Every single Surf & Sales event has been magic. Every group has gelled and bonded. Each group is still closely connected and communicating regularly. Guests have hired each other, started new ventures together, and cheered each other on through all kinds of life and career milestones.

Our job is simply to create the space where the magic can happen, and invite a group of adventurous, open-minded sales pros to join us. The rest is easy.

---

### Scene 3: The Sculptor Reveals Himself

**The Sculptor:**

"By the way, I'm The Sculptor. My job is to explain any inconsistencies in your public persona so you don't accidentally contradict yourself and look like an asshole."

"Speaking of inconsistencies, what's your take on hustle culture? Early career you were all about the grind, now you seem to be explicitly anti-hustle. Is that a different message depending on the audience? Is there a version of hustle or grind you still believe in?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

i think early in my career i thought it was the only way. maybe it was then. but either i changed or the world changed. and i just dont think people need to work 12 hrs a day to advance in their career just to get paid decent but make their CEOs billionaires.

---

### AI and CS

**The Sculptor:**

"What's your current take on AI automation? Sometimes it seems like you say that human-to-human sales is at risk of being disrupted by AI, but then you say CS, not AI, is the future. At the end of the day, what GTM work will always require humans?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

i said CS because i think its much harder now to get a new customer than its ever been. so you better do even better at keeping and growing your customers spend

---

### SDRs

**The Sculptor:**

"Finally -- we gotta talk about SDRs. You've called the SDR model dying. But you also say losing SDRs means losing market intel, pattern recognition, the farm league. How do you hold both? When someone asks 'should I hire an SDR?' -- what's the real answer?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

AI will eventually replace most salespeople. i believe that. just dont know when. as for SDRs the model is definitely dying and all the other things. i dont think ppl need SDRs. i think they need salespeople who actually prospect and sell.

---

### Scene 4: Checking In

**The Sculptor:**

"'Stop X. Start Y.' -- you end a lot of posts this way. Intentional?"

"'That's not philosophy. That's math.' Is that something you want me to reinforce, or just a line you like?"

"When you sit down to write a post, are there any structures you follow?"

"What are 2-3 things that are the MOST sacred to you -- things you'd never compromise on?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

Stop Start - do i? interesting. idk im probably trying to game the fucking algo. math not philosophy is just a line i wrote. not a theme. when i write i just write whatever the heck comes to mind

---

**The Sculptor:**

"And the sacred things? The 2-3 things you'd never compromise on?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

business wise?

---

**The Sculptor:**

"However you want to take it. Business, personal, life in general."

---

**Scott Leese:**

idk man, im pretty flexible

---

### People

**The Sculptor:**

"Mike Lindstrom is the 'double your rate' guy. Any other mentors or influences worth capturing?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

no other mentors really. richard and i are friends and business partners.

---

### Content Style

**The Sculptor:**

"Any intentional content styles or anything you want to share about how you write?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

just be bold direct and authentic. tell the harsh truths others wont. be kind and caring but in a no bullshit way.

---

### Scene 5: Rapid Fire

**The Sculptor:**

"Should I continue to reference Wu-Tang when it makes sense?"

"'Seeing more ghosts than Bill Murray' -- is there a Gen-Z refresh here, or is this dated on purpose?"

"Cool to reference the 41 allergies and 'paleo-ish' diet?"

"When you rant about something, should we always include the 'solution,' or is it sometimes enough to just vent and end the post without one?"

"Pipeline 12:1 -- hard and fast rule, or more of a rule of thumb?"

---

**Scott Leese:**

yes you can reference anyting about my health is fine. sometimes its enough to just vent. pipeline to quota ratio for me is 10-1

---

### The Exit

**The Sculptor:**

"That's all I got, bud. Next up is The Polisher. He's a nice guy, but he's a bit of a character. Well -- you'll see."

*He disintegrates in front of you.*

*You wake up covered in lake water.*

---
