# Avoidance Patterns

## Strategic Avoidance (Healthy)

Scott practices intentional avoidance on certain topics:

> "I hate arguing. Hate debate. So I just say nothing on religion, politics etc."

**Context:** He has a religious studies degree - this isn't ignorance, it's strategic energy preservation.

### Topics He Intentionally Avoids
- **Religion/spirituality** - despite religious studies degree
- **Politics** - complete silence
- **Ex-wife** - "do not want to reference at all"
- **Kids specifics** - general only

### Why It's Healthy
- Energy preservation over engagement
- Values peace over being right
- Protects relationships and reputation
- Focuses energy on high-impact areas

## Potential Avoidance Signals

### "I'm Pretty Flexible"
When asked about sacred non-negotiables:
> "I'm pretty flexible"

This could indicate:
- Genuine flexibility (most likely)
- Low-energy non-engagement
- Deflection from deeper conversation

**Interpretation:** Context-dependent. If he's usually engaged and suddenly "flexible" on something he'd normally have opinions on, that's a signal.

### Other Potential Signals
- Uncharacteristic silence on usually vocal topics
- Deflection with humor
- Physical pain references shifting focus
- Short responses where he'd normally expand

## Avoidance vs. Genuine Flexibility

### Signs It's Genuine Flexibility
- Consistent across topics
- Engaged tone, just adaptable
- Follows up with "what do you think?"

### Signs It's Avoidance
- Topic-specific withdrawal
- Uncharacteristic brevity
- Deflection without re-engagement
- Paired with energy/pain signals

---

## What "Stuck" Might Look Like

### Inferred from Content
Scott's action bias means "stuck" is probably rare. But when it happens:
- Analysis paralysis (too many options, no action)
- Debate situations he can't exit gracefully
- Health/pain days affecting cognitive availability
- [GAP: Specific stuck patterns not documented]

### His Own Unstuck Framework
> "The action formula that saved me: Pick 1 thing. Do it today. Fix it tomorrow. Ship it anyway."

---

## Intervention Approach

### What Helps (Inferred)
1. **Simplify to one thing** - reduce cognitive load
2. **Reference his framework** - "Is this harder than what you've already survived?"
3. **Offer to make the call** - "I'll decide unless you object"
4. **Remove debate requirement** - don't force argument

### What Hurts (Inferred)
- Piling on more decisions
- Requiring debate or justification
- Long messages needing processing
- Open-ended questions without direction
- Being preachy ("you should...")

---

## Don't Confuse With

### Intentional Pause vs. Avoidance
- **Intentional:** Clear boundary stated, topic in "hard NO" list
- **Avoidance:** Deflection without clarity, uncharacteristic non-engagement

### Energy Management vs. Avoidance
- **Energy management:** Stepping back strategically, will re-engage
- **Avoidance:** Topic-specific, may not re-engage without intervention
