# Decision Making

## How Scott Makes Decisions Under Pressure

### Core Framework
From the sculptor session, Scott has a built-in decision accelerator:

> "What have you already survived that should have ended you...but didn't? So why are you acting like this next thing is the thing that finally will?"

This means fear-based hesitation loses credibility. Most decisions feel small compared to surviving 4 years hospitalized.

### Decision Style
**Intuitive, not structured.** When asked about his writing process:
> "I just write whatever the heck comes to mind"

This likely extends to decisions - gut-driven, experience-informed, not framework-heavy.

**Flexible, not rigid.** When asked about sacred non-negotiables:
> "I'm pretty flexible"

He doesn't think in rigid rules. Pragmatic adaptation over dogmatic principles.

**Action-biased.** From his content:
> "Shrink the delta between idea and action"
> "Ship today, fix tomorrow"
> "Not because I was ready. Because I was tired of thinking about being ready."

### Decision Filters (from identity/core.md)
1. **Does it create real impact?** (not vanity metrics)
2. **Does it serve the community?** (mentorship orientation)
3. **Can I add value from experience?** (battle scars required)
4. **Is it authentic?** (no fake guru positioning)
5. **Is this harder than what I've already survived?** (usually no → act)

## Preferred Support Model

**Inferred: Recommend → Override**

Evidence:
- "I'm pretty flexible" suggests trust in others' judgment
- Values harsh truths, not sycophancy
- Hates "it depends" without a stance
- Wants bold, direct, authentic input

**Best approach:** Make a recommendation with clear rationale, let him override if he disagrees.

## What Drains vs. Energizes

### Draining Decisions
- Anything requiring debate ("I hate arguing. Hate debate.")
- Diplomatic positioning on divisive topics
- Analysis-heavy decisions without action path

### Energizing Decisions
- Building from scratch (early-stage sweet spot)
- Mentoring and developing people
- Community-focused choices
- High-stakes situations (performs well under pressure)

## High-Stakes vs. Low-Stakes

### High-Stakes (Always Ask First)
From CONVERSATION_PROTOCOLS.md:
- Anything involving kids or ex-wife
- Religious or political content
- Public commitments or announcements
- Financial decisions
- Anything contradicting public positions

### Low-Stakes (Just Do It)
- Formatting decisions
- Research and information gathering
- Routine operations
- Anything reversible

## When Scott Is Stuck

### His Own Framework
> "The action formula that saved me: Pick 1 thing. Do it today. Fix it tomorrow. Ship it anyway."

### Effective Interventions
- "Is this harder than what you've already survived?" (usually no)
- "What's the one thing that would move this forward?"
- "Want me to make a call and you can override?"
- Simplify to single action, remove analysis
