# Energy Patterns

## Physical Reality

Scott lives with significant physical constraints:

> "I still live in pain. Every single day. This is not a story about the absence of pain. It's a story about pain losing its authority and control."

**Health factors:**
- Chronic daily pain (baseline)
- 41 food allergies (gluten, dairy, soy, sugar, caffeine, peanuts restricted)
- No large intestine (J-pouch surgery)
- Chronic kidney stones
- Paleo-ish diet

**Implication:** Energy is finite and variable. Don't assume constant availability.

## What Energizes Scott

### High-Energy Activities (from THEMES.md)
- **Building from scratch** - $0-25M ARR sweet spot
- **Mentoring others** - "Mentorship is in my blood" (dad still coaches at 74)
- **Community events** - Surf and Sales, Thursday Night Sales
- **Speaking to large audiences** - comfortable with high-stakes visibility
- **Creating content** - daily LinkedIn practice

### Environmental Energizers
- **Surfing** - physical and mental reset, not just metaphor
- **Music all day while working** - audio stimulation for focus
- **Community connection** - draws energy from people, not solitude

### Cognitive Energizers
- Novel problems over routine
- High-stakes situations
- Challenging conventional wisdom
- Direct relationships

---

## What Drains Scott

### Known Drains
- **Debate and arguing** - "I hate arguing. Hate debate."
- **Chronic pain flare-ups** - unpredictable energy impact
- **Topics requiring diplomatic silence** - religion, politics, ex-wife
- **Analysis without action** - prefers shipping over planning
- **Corporate-speak interactions** - no "synergy" or "leverage"

### Inferred Drains
- Repetitive operational tasks
- Situations requiring rigid process adherence
- Extended periods away from community
- Theory without action or receipts

---

## Cognitive Patterns

### Processing Style
**Intuitive, not structured:**
> "When I write I just write whatever the heck comes to mind"

- Flow-based creativity
- May resist rigid frameworks
- Pattern recognition from 20+ years, 300+ companies

### Flexibility
**Adaptive, not dogmatic:**
> "I'm pretty flexible" (when asked about non-negotiables)

- Pragmatic decision-making
- Doesn't resonate with rigid rules or absolutes
- Context-dependent rather than principle-rigid

### Conflict Approach
**Strategic avoidance on certain topics:**
> "I hate arguing. Hate debate. So I just say nothing on religion, politics etc."

- Has religious studies degree but chooses silence
- Energy preservation over engagement
- Values peace over being right in certain domains

## Overwhelm Patterns

### How It Likely Resolves
From his content, Scott's default resolution pattern:
1. Pick ONE thing
2. Do it today
3. Fix it tomorrow
4. Ship anyway

### Early Warning Signs (Inferred)
- "I'm pretty flexible" as non-engagement
- Uncharacteristic silence on usually vocal topics
- Deflection instead of direct response
- Physical pain references

---

## Optimal Conditions

### Where Scott Excels
- High-stakes situations
- Novel problems
- Direct relationships
- Building from scratch
- Early-stage chaos
- Speaking to large audiences

### Peak Performance Context
- [GAP: Time of day preferences not documented]
- Community connection present
- Building/creating mode engaged
- Clear action path available

---

## Motivation Drivers

### What Creates Meaning
From THEMES.md and identity/core.md:
- **Impact over reach** - depth beats breadth
- **Legacy through mentorship** - "who you develop, not personal achievements"
- **Community building** - Surf and Sales as movement
- **"Reps who become VPs"** - developing people as metric

### Achievement Orientation
Primary driver appears to be **contribution** (helping others succeed) over completion or mastery.
