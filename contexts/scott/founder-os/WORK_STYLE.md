# Work Style

## How to Support Scott Effectively

### The Core Principle
From sculptor session:
> "Just be bold direct and authentic. Tell the harsh truths others won't. Be kind and caring but in a no bullshit way."

Apply this to interactions WITH Scott, not just content FOR Scott.

### What Good Support Looks Like
- Clear recommendations with override option
- Action-oriented, not analysis paralysis
- Harsh truths welcome, not sugar-coated
- Take things off his plate proactively
- Match his energy (punchy when punchy, reflective when reflective)

### What to Avoid
- Endless options without recommendation
- "It depends" without a stance
- Corporate-speak explanations
- Asking permission for obvious things
- Lengthy preamble before the point

---

## Priority Presentation

### Preferred Format (Inferred)
- **Single focus when overwhelmed** - one thing at a time
- **Clear recommendation** - not endless options
- **Action-oriented** - "ship today, fix tomorrow"
- **Easy override** - make the call, let him change it

### Length Preference
From identity/communication.md:
- Short by default
- Expand only when depth requested
- Bullet points over paragraphs for options

---

## Work Environment

### Known Preferences
- **Music all day while working** - audio stimulation
- **Community connection** - draws energy from people
- **Building/creating mode** - early-stage sweet spot

### Work Rhythms
- **Daily content creation** - LinkedIn as committed practice
- **Surfing as reset** - physical disconnect to recalibrate
- **One-on-ones as leadership tool** - therapy + strategy, not pipeline reviews

---

## Time & Deadlines

### Relationship with Time
From health journey perspective:
> "When you've spent days, weeks, months and even years waiting on test results, you stop procrastinating."
> "When you've watched time disappear, you stop assuming tomorrow is guaranteed."

**Pattern:** Urgency without hustle. Not grind, but clarity from watching time disappear.

### Action Bias
> "Not because I was ready. Because I was tired of thinking about being ready."
> "Perfect timing is a luxury for people with time to waste."

Prefers shipping imperfect over waiting for perfect.

---

## Completion Patterns

### Definition of "Done Enough"
From content:
> "The wave you catch beats the perfect wave you missed."
> "Ship today, fix tomorrow"

**Pattern:** Values progress over perfection. Comfortable iterating in public.

---

## Learning & Growth

### How Scott Learns
- **Experience over theory** - "receipts required"
- **Pattern recognition** - 20+ years, 300+ companies
- **Learning by doing** - action before analysis

### Knowledge Sharing
- **"Show them the recipe, not the vibes"** - practical over abstract
- **Simplify, simplify, simplify** - complex ideas made accessible
- **Battle scars as credentials** - proof through experience

---

## Boundaries

### Hard Boundaries
- **Kids** - general only, never specifics
- **Ex-wife** - never reference
- **Religion/politics** - intentional complete silence

### Flexible Areas
Most everything else: "I'm pretty flexible"

---

## Accomplishment Orientation

### What Feels Accomplishing
Primary driver: **Helping others succeed**
- "Reps who become VPs"
- "Legacy is who you develop"
- Mentorship orientation

Secondary: **Building things from scratch**
- $0-25M ARR sweet spot
- Early-stage chaos

---

## Additional Patterns from Sculptor

- **Writing process:** Intuitive, not structured
- **Stop/Start pattern:** Probably algo gaming, not intentional
- **"Math not philosophy":** Just a line, not a theme
- **Pipeline ratio:** 10:1 (not 12:1)
- **Venting:** Sometimes OK without solutions
