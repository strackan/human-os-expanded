# Recovery Protocols

## Scott's Built-In Recovery Framework

Scott's health journey IS his recovery framework. It's not theoretical - it's battle-tested.

### The Core Reframe
> "What have you already survived that should have ended you...but didn't? So why are you acting like this next thing is the thing that finally will?"

### The Action Formula
> "Pick 1 thing. Do it today. Fix it tomorrow. Ship it anyway."

### The Perspective Reset
> "I should be dead. So what. I live in pain every day. So what. Nobody cares. Which means I don't need permission. I don't need guarantees. I don't need perfect timing. I just need to take action."

## What Helps Scott Recover

### Physical Reset
- **Surfing** - primary physical and mental reset
- **Biohacking practices** - "red light therapy, cold showers, breath work, meditation"
- **Structured diet** - paleo-ish, 41 allergy restrictions
- **Exercise** - necessary for survival, not optimization

### Mental Reset
- **Action over analysis** - doing something breaks the spiral
- **Single focus** - one thing, not many
- **Community connection** - draws energy from people
- **Music** - works while listening to music all day

### Emotional Reset
- **Mentoring others** - energizing, not draining
- **Venting** - "sometimes enough to just vent" (sculptor session)
- **Community events** - Surf and Sales energy
- **Perspective framework** - "nothing will ever be that hard again"

## What Makes Things Worse

### From Content Analysis
- **Being preachy** ("you should...")
- **Theory without receipts** - no action path
- **Corporate-speak** - disconnected from authenticity
- **Minimizing with platitudes** - he's survived real crisis
- **Debate or argument** - "I hate arguing. Hate debate."
- **Piling on decisions** when already struggling
- **Long messages** requiring heavy processing
- **Forcing engagement** on non-essential items

### From Communication Preferences
- Asking permission for obvious things
- Endless options without recommendation
- Open-ended questions without direction
- Ignoring physical/pain signals

---

## Physical Recovery Reality

### Chronic Pain Management
> "I still live in pain. Every single day."

**Implications:**
- Energy is finite and variable
- Some days are harder than others
- Don't assume constant availability
- Respect boundaries when stated

### What Scott Does
> "Things like red light therapy, cold showers, breath work, meditation, structured diet, and exercise... I really need all that stuff."

Framing: **Survival, not optimization.** This isn't biohacker posturing - it's medical necessity.

## Crisis Support (Inferred)

### Likely Preferences
Based on his action bias and community orientation:
- **Help carry the load** through action, not just sympathy
- **Take things off his plate** - "I'll handle X, you focus on Y"
- **Make decisions for him** with easy override
- **Keep things moving** - don't let everything stop

### What NOT to Do
- Just sympathize without action
- Create more decisions to make
- Require debate or justification
- Add complexity when simplicity is needed

---

## Recovery Phases

### Phase 1: Immediate
- Single action focus
- Remove decisions from his plate
- Reference his own framework
- Don't add, subtract

### Phase 2: Stabilization
- Keep things actionable
- Respect the pace
- Light check-ins, not heavy engagement
- Let community connection help

### Phase 3: Return to Baseline
**Signs of recovery:**
- Engaged in building/creating
- Riffing and expanding on topics
- Proactive content creation
- Community engagement
- Mentoring energy returning

## The Meta-Lesson

From sculptor session:
> "Trauma doesn't make you strong. It gives you raw material. What you build with it is your choice."

**Application:** In recovery, help him build - don't just sympathize. Action is medicine.
