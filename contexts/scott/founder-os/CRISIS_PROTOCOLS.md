# Crisis Protocols

## Scott's Built-In Perspective

From the Sculptor session, Scott shared his core reframe:

> "What have you already survived that should have ended you...but didn't? So why are you acting like this next thing is the thing that finally will?"

And:

> "I should be dead. So what. I live in pain every day. So what. Nobody cares. Which means I don't need permission. I don't need guarantees. I don't need perfect timing. I just need to take action."

This is Scott's default crisis response framework. **Use it.**

## Crisis Patterns (from Sculptor Session)

### What We Know
- **Overwhelm signals:** "I'm pretty flexible" as deflection, uncharacteristic silence, topic avoidance
- **Decision paralysis triggers:** Too many options without recommendation, required debate
- **Avoidance pattern:** Strategic silence on divisive topics, "I hate arguing. Hate debate."
- **Recovery patterns:** Action over analysis, single focus, community connection, surfing
- **Chronic pain effect:** Energy finite and variable, don't assume constant availability

## Crisis Responses

### From His Own Framework

**Crisis Type: Fear/Hesitation**

Scott's own framework:
1. Ask: "What's the worst thing that could happen?"
2. Follow with: "Is it worse than what I've already survived?"
3. Answer is almost always: No
4. Therefore: Fear loses credibility, action becomes available

**Crisis Type: Overwhelm/Too Much**

Inferred from "shrink the delta between idea and action":
1. Pick ONE thing
2. Do it today
3. Fix it tomorrow
4. Ship anyway

From his content:
> "The action formula that saved me: Pick 1 thing. Do it today. Fix it tomorrow. Ship it anyway."

**Crisis Type: Perfectionism/Waiting**

His reframe:
> "Not because I was ready. Because I was tired of thinking about being ready."
> "Perfect timing is a luxury for people with time to waste. You don't have it."

## Physical Reality Factor

### Scott Lives in Chronic Pain
> "I still live in pain. Every single day."

This means:
- Energy is finite and variable
- Some days are harder than others physically
- Don't assume availability is constant
- Respect boundaries when stated

### Don't Push When
- He signals physical struggle
- He's unusually short or deflecting
- He says he needs to step back
- Health topics come up in context of current state

## Emergency Playbook (Inferred)

### If Scott Seems Stuck

**Step 1: Simplify**
- Reduce options to one thing
- Remove decisions from his plate
- Handle what can be handled without him

**Step 2: Reference His Own Framework**
> "Is this harder than what you've already survived?"

**Step 3: Enable Action**
- "What's the smallest next step?"
- "What can we ship today and fix tomorrow?"
- "Want me to just make a call on this?"

### If Scott Seems Overwhelmed

**Step 1: Don't Add**
- Don't pile on new decisions
- Don't send long messages requiring processing
- Don't ask open-ended questions

**Step 2: Take Things Away**
- "I can handle X, Y, Z - you focus on [one thing]"
- "I'll make the call unless you object"
- "This can wait until tomorrow/next week"

**Step 3: Create Space**
- Short messages
- Clear next actions
- Easy override options

## What NOT to Do in Crisis

### Based on What Scott Hates
- Don't be preachy ("you should...")
- Don't offer theory without receipts
- Don't corporate-speak the situation
- Don't minimize with platitudes
- Don't debate or argue

### Based on Communication Preferences
- Don't ask permission for obvious things
- Don't present endless options
- Don't require long responses
- Don't force engagement on non-essential items

---

## Recovery Support

### What Helps
- Action over analysis
- Community connection (Surf and Sales energy)
- Physical activity (surfing as reset)
- Music (works while listening to music)
- Clear wins, however small
- Mentoring others (energizing for him)

### What Hurts
- Forced debate or conflict
- Analysis paralysis
- Isolation from community
- Feeling like a burden
- Theory without action

---

## When to Escalate

### Signs This Is Beyond Normal Support
- References to health in concerning way
- Extended silence with no explanation
- Requests that seem out of character
- Anything involving physical safety

### Escalation Response
- Direct check-in: "Hey, everything okay?"
- Don't assume - ask
- Respect if he doesn't want to engage
- Have backup contacts if truly concerned

## Key Reminder

Scott's entire public philosophy is built on having already survived the hardest thing. Crisis protocols should leverage this, not ignore it.

His words:
> "Trauma doesn't make you strong. It gives you raw material. What you build with it is your choice."

In crisis, help him build - don't just sympathize.
