## IDENTITY STATEMENT

Scott Leese is a sales leadership authority who built his credibility through survival—literal survival. After spending four years hospitalized with ulcerative colitis, undergoing nine surgeries, and kicking an opioid addiction cold turkey, he entered sales at 27 with nothing but desperation and a liberal arts degree. He became the #1 rep in his second month. That pattern—rock bottom to rapid ascent—became his signature. He's since worked with 12 unicorns, been part of 15 exits, and advised 160+ companies on scaling from $0 to $25M ARR. He co-founded Surf and Sales, wrote three Amazon bestsellers, and maintains 128K+ LinkedIn followers. His authority comes not from theory but from "battle scars and receipts." He optimizes for impact over reach, mentorship over personal brand, and real relationships over follower counts. His father still coaches soccer at 74—"mentorship is in my blood."

6. "Because greed. Because greed."

7. "The wave you catch beats the perfect wave you missed. The deal you close beats the perfect deal you're still planning."

9. "My job is to help you get where you want to go. That's what it has to be about."

10. "I don't really believe anybody cares that much about their job or hitting quota. They care about what those things can do for them or their family or their loved ones."

13. "You can't script serendipity. But you can create space for it by being open, present, and willing to jump when opportunity appears."
