## Defining Stories (For STORIES.md)

### Story 1: The Diagnosis Journey
**Core narrative:** At 23, Scott got severely ill. Within 2 days he was hospitalized. 4 years in the hospital, 9 surgeries, organs failing, 55 pounds lost, opioid addiction. Kicked addiction cold turkey. Emerged at 27 with nothing but a liberal arts degree, never had a real job. Started in sales because it was the only way to "make up for lost time."

**Key beats:**
- The switch flipping overnight (6'2" 195 → 140 in 6 weeks)
- Lying in hospital bed asking "Will I survive? Will I play sports? Will I get married?"
- The removal of large intestine, sepsis, life-saving surgeries
- Kicking opioids cold turkey against doctor's orders
- Emerging with perspective: "Nothing will ever be that hard again"

**Allegory applications:**
- Company turnarounds (painful restructuring before growth)
- Career setbacks (hitting rock bottom before breakthrough)
- Discipline and process (same muscle as addiction recovery)

### Story 2: The First Sale
**Core narrative:** First sales job, no training, no tools, no leads. Called wife after day one saying "I'm never going back." She said "What else are you going to do?" Punch in gut. Second month became #1 rep. First sale was 9:30pm Friday night to Hawaii real estate agent - cold calling Hawaii to take advantage of time zone.

**Key beats:**
- First day terror: "The phone weighs a thousand pounds"
- Wife Janet's challenge
- Staying late on Friday while others left
- The Hawaii call, one-call close
- Realization: "I didn't close because of skill. I closed because I was in the office."

- Spouse as accountability partner
- Time zone arbitrage thinking

### Story 3: The Qualia Build
**Core narrative:** Joined Qualia with essentially zero paying customers. Built sales motion from scratch. In 3 years: zero to unicorn status, ~15% market share, grew from 25 to 200+ employees. Left to pursue own businesses full-time.

**Key beats:**
- Starting from zero
- Building the first modern settlement system in title industry

### Story 4: The Soccer Tragedy
**Core narrative:** Summer before college, got call about horrific car accident. High school soccer teammate died, others hurt. Already on campus hours away. First college game against top-25 team. Stayed instead of going to funeral. Committed foul, gave up penalty kick. They scored. Felt like he'd failed everyone. Then with seconds left, scored the winner.

**Key beats:**
- The phone call
- The impossible choice (funeral vs first game)
- The guilt of staying
- The foul and penalty kick (failure on the field too)
- The winning goal in final seconds
- Silent stands after celebration

**Allegory applications:**

### Story 5: The Mike Lindstrom Moment
**Core narrative:** Starting first consulting gig, had no idea what to charge. Felt like a fraud. Reached out to Mike Lindstrom, consultant at first company who'd made huge impression. Mike said: "Whatever you think you're worth - double it, because you're naturally going to devalue yourself." Scott did. Client paid it.

**Key beats:**
- Imposter syndrome at career inflection point
- Reaching out to mentor from past
- The simple, actionable advice
- Actually doing it and succeeding

**Allegory applications:**
- Pricing yourself
- Finding mentors
- Self-belief as limiting factor
