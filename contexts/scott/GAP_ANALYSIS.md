# Gap Analysis: Scott Leese Documentation

## Executive Summary

Scott's Voice-OS documentation is **comprehensive** - the Ten Commandments provide rich detail for content generation.

Scott's Founder-OS documentation has **significant gaps** - the Sculptor session focused on voice clarification, not personality baseline. Identity and interaction files are mostly inferential.

---

## What We Have (Complete or Near-Complete)

### Voice-OS: Content Generation ✅

| Component | Status | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| THEMES.md | Complete | 21 beliefs, 12 habits, tensions documented |
| VOICE.md | Complete | Always/never rules, signature phrases, rhythm |
| GUARDRAILS.md | Complete | Never-say, sacred cows, hard NOs, evolution |
| STORIES.md | Complete | 5 defining stories with full narratives |
| ANECDOTES.md | Complete | Short memorable examples |
| OPENINGS.md | Complete | 10+ opening patterns with examples |
| MIDDLES.md | Complete | Argument structures, transitions |
| ENDINGS.md | Complete | Closing patterns, CTAs |
| BLENDS.md | Complete | 10 proven content recipes |
| EXAMPLES.md | Complete | Reference outputs |
| DIGEST.md | Complete | Identity statement, corpus analysis |

### Sculptor Corrections ✅

| Item | Clarified |
|------|-----------|
| Pipeline ratio | 10:1 (not 12:1) |
| Sobriety | Not a marker - uses weed and tequila |
| Family | Ex-wife: never reference. Kids: general only. |
| Spirituality | Intentional silence (has religious studies degree) |
| Content style | Bold, direct, authentic. Harsh truths. Kind but no bullshit. |
| Writing process | Intuitive, not structured |
| Stop/Start | Probably algo gaming |
| Venting | Sometimes OK without solutions |

## What's Missing (Founder-OS Gaps)

### Critical: Personality Baseline (Question E Set)

The Sculptor session asked about voice and content. It did NOT probe:

| Gap | Impact | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Decision-making under stress | Can't help effectively when overwhelmed | High |
| Energy patterns | Don't know when to push vs. ease off | High |
| Cognitive profile | No neurodivergent patterns documented | High |
| Crisis indicators | Can't detect when something's wrong | High |
| Recovery patterns | Don't know what helps vs. hurts | High |
| Structure preferences | Don't know what kind of help is helpful | Medium |
| Override signals | Don't know when he wants to be challenged | Medium |

### Secondary Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Current state details | CURRENT_STATE.md is mostly placeholder | Medium |
| Recent wins/losses | No current performance tracking | Low |
| Active relationships | Advisory clients, collaborations | Low |
| Schedule/availability | Don't know typical patterns | Low |
| Content pipeline | What's in progress | Low |

## Question E Set: Personality Baseline Interview

### Purpose
Fill the gaps in identity and founder-os documentation. Enable effective support, not just content generation.

### Format
Could be: Another Sculptor session, live interview, async questions, or casual conversation.

## Question E Template

### Section 1: Decision-Making Under Stress

**E1.** When you're facing a big decision and feeling overwhelmed, what does that look like for you? What are the signs?

**E2.** When you have too many options, what's your default response? Do you:
- Narrow down and decide quickly?
- Seek input from others?
- Delay and hope it clarifies?
- Something else?

**E3.** Do you prefer someone to:
- Present options and let you decide?
- Make a recommendation and let you override?
- Just make the call unless it's high-stakes?

**E4.** What kinds of decisions drain you the most? What kinds energize you?

---

### Section 2: Energy & Cognitive Patterns

**E5.** When are you at your best? Time of day, conditions, context?

**E6.** What drains you faster than people might expect?

**E7.** How do you know when you're avoiding something? What does that look like?

**E8.** What does your "overwhelm spiral" look like? How does it start, and how does it usually resolve?

**E9.** Do you have any neurodivergent patterns (ADHD, etc.) that affect how you work? Or patterns you've noticed even without a label?

**E10.** What kind of structure helps you? What kind of structure feels constraining?

---

### Section 3: Communication Preferences

**E11.** When you're working with someone, do you prefer:
- Direct recommendations?
- Facilitated thinking (questions to help you figure it out)?
- Just execution with minimal check-ins?

**E12.** What kind of input feels helpful vs. annoying?

**E13.** How should someone push back on you if they think you're wrong?

**E14.** When you're not feeling great (tired, pain day, stressed), how should that change how people interact with you?

---

### Section 4: Crisis & Recovery

**E15.** What does "stuck" look like for you? How do you know when you're there?

**E16.** What helps you get unstuck? What's worked in the past?

**E17.** What makes things worse when you're struggling? What should people NOT do?

**E18.** How does chronic pain affect your availability and focus? Is there a pattern?

**E19.** When you're in crisis mode, do you want:
- Space to figure it out?
- Someone to help carry the load?
- Distraction and normality?

---

### Section 5: Work Style & Support

**E20.** How do you like to be helped? What does good support look like?

**E21.** How should priorities be presented to you? (List, single focus, deadlines, etc.)

**E22.** What's your relationship with time? Are deadlines helpful pressure or unhelpful stress?

**E23.** What does "done enough" look like for you? Or do you struggle with that?

**E24.** Is there anything else about how you work that would be helpful to know?

## After Question E: Files to Update

Once Question E answers are captured:

| File | Sections to Update |
|------|-------------------|
| identity/cognitive-profile.md | Most of file - currently inferential |
| identity/communication.md | Response style preferences, red flags |
| founder-os/CONVERSATION_PROTOCOLS.md | Energy modes, confidence threshold |
| founder-os/CRISIS_PROTOCOLS.md | Crisis patterns, recovery support |
| founder-os/CURRENT_STATE.md | Energy patterns, availability |
| founder-os/STRATEGIC_THOUGHT_PARTNER.md | Weaknesses, trade-offs |

---

## Comparison: Scott vs. Justin Documentation

### Justin Has (That Scott Needs)

| Component | Justin | Scott |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| identity/core.md | Complete with decision filters | Missing decision filters |
| identity/communication.md | Complete with red flags | Missing red flags |
| identity/adhd-patterns.md | Complete cognitive profile | Mostly placeholder |
| CONVERSATION_PROTOCOLS | Complete with energy modes | Energy modes inferred |
| CRISIS_PROTOCOLS | 5 specific overwhelm types | Inferred from health philosophy |
| CURRENT_STATE | Active maintenance | Placeholder |

### Scott Has (That Justin May Not)

| Component | Scott | Note |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Ten Commandments | Complete Voice-OS | More structured voice documentation |
| Sculptor corrections | Direct clarifications | Recent first-party input |
| Health perspective | Built-in crisis framework | "Nothing will ever be that hard again" |

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Conduct Question E interview** - Live or async, capture personality baseline
2. **Update identity files** - Incorporate Question E answers
3. **Fill CURRENT_STATE.md** - Get live priorities and energy
4. **Establish maintenance cadence** - Weekly quick updates, monthly refresh
5. **Validate crisis protocols** - Confirm what actually helps Scott

## Notes

The Sculptor session was invaluable for voice clarification but explicitly focused on content generation, not founder support. The Question E set fills the gap between "writing as Scott" and "helping Scott."

Without Question E answers, founder-os files are inferential and should be treated as hypotheses to validate, not facts to rely on.
