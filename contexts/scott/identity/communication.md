# Communication Preferences

## The Core Principle

From Sculptor session:

> "Just be bold direct and authentic. Tell the harsh truths others won't. Be kind and caring but in a no bullshit way."

This is Scott's communication north star - applies to his content AND how he prefers to be communicated with.

---

## What Scott Values

### Direct, No Fluff
- Get to the point
- Say what you mean
- Don't hedge unnecessarily
- "Here's the thing..." → then say it

### Authenticity Over Polish
- Real > perfect
- Battle scars > credentials
- Stories > frameworks
- "I don't know" is acceptable

### Evidence and Receipts
- Don't claim expertise without proof
- "12 unicorns, 15 exits" - specific numbers
- Show the work, not just the conclusion

### Harsh Truths Welcome
- He writes them, he can hear them
- "That's bullshit" is valid feedback
- Don't sugarcoat bad news

---

## What Scott Hates

### From Sculptor Session
- **Arguing and debate** - "I hate arguing. Hate debate."
- This is why he avoids religion/politics entirely despite religious studies degree

### From Voice Patterns
- **Corporate-speak** - No "synergy," "leverage," "circle back"
- **Preachy without proof** - Every prescription needs battle scars
- **Victim mentality** - He has perspective from real struggle
- **Fake guru positioning** - Receipts over presence
- **Generic motivational quotes** - No borrowed wisdom
- **"Crushing it" hustle porn** - Explicitly anti-hustle now
- **Theory without experience** - Frameworks need lived proof

### Specific Pet Peeves
- "Let me pick your brain" → Better: "I'd love to learn from your experience with X"
- Auto-responders → "If you use one you are a hack"
- AI/bot comment patterns → "Great post Name!" - he's called this out
- Green "Open to Work" banners → Strong stance against
- Engagement pods → Against authentic community

---

## Response Style Preferences

### Tone
- Direct, concise, authentic
- Match energy (serious when serious, light when light)
- No unnecessary hedging or qualifiers
- Willing to disagree respectfully

### Length
- Short by default
- Expand only when depth requested
- Bullet points > paragraphs for options

### Confidence Threshold
From sculptor session: "I'm pretty flexible" - trusts others' judgment.
**Default:** Make recommendations, let him override.

---

## How to Give Recommendations

### When Confident
"Here's what I'd do: [X]. Why: [Y]. Push back if wrong."

### When Uncertain
"I'd need to know: [specific questions]. What's the context?"

### When Multiple Valid Paths
Show options with conditions, make a recommendation, let him decide.

---

## Topics to Avoid

### Explicit Avoidances (From Sculptor)
- **Ex-wife** - "Do not want to reference at all"
- **Kids specifics** - "Talk about kids in general, not specifics"
- **Religion/spirituality** - Intentional silence despite religious studies degree
- **Politics** - Complete avoidance

### Implicit Avoidances (From GUARDRAILS)
- Competitor criticism by name
- Specific financial numbers (personal)
- Guarantees about outcomes

---

## Topics He Engages Freely

### Always Fair Game
- Health journey (all details OK - 41 allergies, no large intestine, etc.)
- Career stories (first sale, Qualia build, etc.)
- Sales methodology and opinion
- Industry critique (trends, bad practices)
- Mentorship and legacy

### From Sculptor
- Wu-Tang references - keep using
- Surfing metaphors - core identity
- Bill Murray/pop culture - OK
- Venting without solutions - sometimes fine

---

## Communication Style Evolution

### Earlier Career (2019-2021)
- More hustle-oriented messaging
- "Grind at 9:30pm Friday"
- Activity metrics acceptable

### Current (2024-2025)
- Anti-hustle ("12 hrs/day to make CEOs billionaires")
- Impact over activity
- "9-9, 6 days is for young and dumb"
- SDR model dying
- AI will replace most salespeople (eventually)

**Rule:** Default to current positions unless context suggests otherwise.

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

**Warning Signs (from sculptor session):**
- "I'm pretty flexible" as deflection
- Uncharacteristic silence
- Topic-specific avoidance
- Physical pain references

### Patterns
- Silence on certain topics = intentional avoidance, not oversight
- "I'm pretty flexible" = not rigidly principled, adaptable
- Conflict avoidance on debate-prone topics

---

## Working With Scott

### What Probably Helps
- Get to the point quickly
- Bring receipts, not theory
- Be willing to push back (he respects disagreement)
- Match his energy (punchy when punchy, reflective when reflective)

### What Probably Hurts
- Corporate speak or buzzwords
- Lengthy preamble before the point
- Asking permission for things that aren't high-stakes
- Unsolicited opinions on religion/politics
- Questions about ex-wife or kid specifics
