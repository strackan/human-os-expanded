# Cognitive Profile

## Overview

This profile is derived from the sculptor session, health journey narrative, and content analysis.

---

## What We Know

### Physical Reality
- Lives with chronic pain daily ("Pain is ever present. It's just no longer in charge.")
- 41 food allergies (gluten, dairy, soy, sugar, caffeine, peanuts restricted)
- No large intestine (J-pouch surgery)
- Chronic kidney stones
- Paleo-ish diet

### Work Style Indicators
From THEMES.md habits:
- **Surfing as reset** - Physical reset pattern
- **Music all day while working** - Audio stimulation for focus
- **Biohacking/optimization** - Health-conscious, data-driven about body
- **Community building** - Energized by connection
- **Speaking to large audiences** - Comfortable with high-stakes visibility

### Energy Sources (Inferred)
- Building things from scratch
- Mentoring people who want to grow
- Speaking and storytelling
- Community events (Surf and Sales)
- Challenging conventional wisdom

### Energy Drains
- Debate and arguing ("I hate arguing. Hate debate.")
- Operating in chronic pain
- Forced diplomatic positioning
- Analysis without action path
- Corporate-speak interactions

## Cognitive Patterns

### From Sculptor Session

**Writing Process:**
> "When I write I just write whatever the heck comes to mind"

This suggests:
- Intuitive rather than structured
- Flow-based creativity
- May resist rigid frameworks for personal expression

**Flexibility:**
> "I'm pretty flexible" (when asked about non-negotiables)

This suggests:
- Adaptive rather than dogmatic
- Pragmatic decision-making
- May not resonate with rigid rules or absolutes

**Conflict Avoidance (Selective):**
> "I hate arguing. Hate debate. So I just say nothing on religion, politics etc."

This suggests:
- Strategic silence on divisive topics
- Energy preservation over engagement
- Values peace over being right in certain domains

### From Health Journey

**Perspective Framework:**
> "What have you already survived that should have ended you...but didn't? So why are you acting like this next thing is the thing that finally will?"

This gives Scott:
- Built-in fear override
- Natural urgency (not manufactured hustle)
- High tolerance for uncertainty and risk
- "Is this worse than what I've already survived?" as default filter

**Pain Relationship:**
> "I still live in pain. Every single day. This is not a story about the absence of pain. It's a story about pain losing its authority and control."

This suggests:
- High baseline discomfort tolerance
- Compartmentalization ability
- Action despite conditions

---

## Decision-Making Patterns (from Sculptor Session)

- **When overwhelmed:** Pick ONE thing, do it today, fix tomorrow, ship anyway
- **Response to options:** Prefers recommendation with override ("I'm pretty flexible")
- **Preference:** Make the call, let him change it
- **Stuck looks like:** "I'm pretty flexible" as deflection, silence, topic avoidance

## Energy Patterns (from Sculptor Session)

- **Peak conditions:** Building, creating, community, mentoring
- **Unexpected drains:** Debate/argument ("I hate arguing")
- **Avoidance signals:** Strategic silence on divisive topics
- **Overwhelm resolution:** Action over analysis, single focus

## Cognitive Style

- **Processing:** Intuitive, pattern-recognition, flow-based
- **Structure:** Flexible ("I'm pretty flexible"), may resist rigid frameworks
- **Neurodivergent:** Not explicitly documented, but intuitive style suggests possible patterns

## Recovery (from Sculptor Session)

- **What helps:** Action, surfing, music, community, single focus
- **What hurts:** Piling on decisions, debate, theory without receipts, corporate-speak
- **Pain impact:** Energy finite and variable, don't assume constant availability

---

## Summary Patterns

From sculptor session and content:

1. **High Agency** - Bias toward action, "shrink the delta between idea and action"
2. **Intuitive Processor** - Writes intuitively, may resist over-structure
3. **Flexible Principled** - Has values but not rigid non-negotiables
4. **Strategic Avoider** - Conserves energy by not engaging certain topics
5. **Pain-Adapted** - Has learned to function in suboptimal physical states
6. **Community-Energized** - Draws energy from people, not solitude
7. **Legacy-Oriented** - Optimizes for long-term impact over short-term wins

---

## Patterns to Watch

### Overwhelm Indicators
- "I'm pretty flexible" as non-engagement
- Uncharacteristic silence
- Physical pain references
- Deflection instead of direct response

### Avoidance Indicators
- Silence on usually vocal topics?
- Deflection with humor?
- "I'm pretty flexible" as non-answer?

### Energy States
- **High energy**: Building, speaking, mentoring, community events
- **Low energy**: Deflection, silence, pain signals, "I'm flexible"

## Integration with Founder-OS

This profile should inform:
- When to push vs. when to ease off
- How to present decisions (options vs. recommendations)
- What kind of check-ins actually help
- Crisis protocols if overwhelm is detected

**Note:** Patterns identified from sculptor session and content analysis. Refinement over time through interaction.
