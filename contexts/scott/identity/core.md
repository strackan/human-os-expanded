# Core Identity

## North Star

**"Impact is everything to me."**

Secondary anchors:
- "Mentorship is in my blood" (Dad still coaches at 74)
- "My job is to help you get where you want to go"
- "Leave a legacy"

Scott optimizes for:
- Impact over reach
- Depth over breadth
- Real relationships over follower counts
- Building things from scratch
- Legacy and lasting influence

## Unfair Advantage

**Perspective from survival.**

> "I should be dead. Not figuratively. Not emotionally. Medically."

4 years, 9 surgeries, opioid addiction kicked cold turkey. This gave Scott:

1. **Permanently lowered cost of courage** - Fear loses credibility when you've already survived worse
2. **Urgency without hustle** - Not grind, but clarity from watching time disappear
3. **Perspective that doesn't negotiate** - Nothing in sales compares to wondering if you'll survive
4. **Battle scars as credentials** - "Desperation beats credentials. Every. Single. Time."

**The reframe:**
> "What have you already survived that should have ended you...but didn't? So why are you acting like this next thing is the thing that finally will?"

## Identity Statement

From DIGEST.md:

> A sales leader who built his career from rock bottom -- 4 years hospitalized, kicked opioid addiction, started in sales at 27 with nothing but desperation and a liberal arts degree. Now: 12 unicorns, 15 exits, 300+ companies coached, 128K followers. Core philosophy: perspective from survival ("nothing will ever be that hard again"), urgency over hustle, impact over vanity metrics. Mentorship driven -- believes legacy is who you develop, not personal achievements. Currently focused on early-stage ($0-25M ARR), Thursday Night Sales community, and content that tells harsh truths others won't.

## Strengths (Leverage These)

### What Scott Excels At
- **Early-stage building** ($0-25M ARR sweet spot)
- **Team building and culture** (reps who become VPs, colleagues who follow company to company)
- **Crisis response** (perspective from real crisis)
- **Pattern recognition** (20+ years, 300+ companies)
- **Authentic vulnerability** (health story opens doors)
- **Simplifying complexity** ("Show them the recipe, not the vibes")
- **Mentorship** (especially self-directed people who want to grow)
- **Community building** (Surf and Sales, Thursday Night Sales)

### Where He Adds Most Value
- GTM strategy for early-stage companies
- Sales team design and hiring
- Comp plan architecture
- Coaching leaders (not just reps)
- Keynote speaking (authentic, not polished)

---

## Weaknesses (Delegate/Systematize)

### What Scott Has Indicated
- **[NEEDS QUESTION E]** - From Sculptor: "I'm pretty flexible" when asked about non-negotiables
- No rigid structure to his writing process ("just write whatever comes to mind")
- Potentially conflict-avoidant on certain topics (religious studies degree but silent on spirituality because "hates arguing")

### Inferred from Content
- May need external accountability for operational details
- Could benefit from structure when energy is scattered
- **[NEEDS QUESTION E]** - Specific cognitive/energy patterns not documented

---

## Decision Filters

### Current Filters (Inferred)
1. **Does it create real impact?** (Impact over vanity metrics)
2. **Does it serve the community?** (Mentorship orientation)
3. **Can I add value from experience?** (Battle scars required)
4. **Is it authentic?** (No fake guru positioning)

### **[NEEDS QUESTION E]** - Missing Filters
- How does Scott make decisions when overwhelmed?
- What's his default response to too many options?
- Does he prefer someone to make the call or present options?

---

## Two-Context Model

### Where Scott EXCELS
- High stakes situations
- Novel problems
- Direct relationships
- Building from scratch
- Early-stage chaos
- Speaking to large audiences

### Where Scott May STRUGGLE
- **[NEEDS QUESTION E]** - Not documented
- Inferred: Operations mode, repetitive tasks, situations requiring diplomatic silence

---

## Sacred Cows (Non-Negotiables)

### From GUARDRAILS.md

1. **Mentorship and coaching others** - Legacy is about who you develop
2. **Health journey transparency** - Vulnerability is strength
3. **Impact over vanity metrics** - Depth beats breadth
4. **Surf and Sales community** - His creation, his people
5. **Early-stage startup focus** - $0-25M ARR sweet spot
6. **Sales as noble profession** - "Blue collar job in white collar world"
7. **Family** - Mentioned with reverence, kept private (especially kids)
8. **Process addiction** - Trust the process through highs and lows

### From Sculptor Session
- When asked about sacred things: "I'm pretty flexible"
- This doesn't mean he has no principles - it means he doesn't think in rigid non-negotiable terms

---

## Values in Action

### What He Fights Against
- Hustle porn and exploitation ("work 12 hrs/day to make CEOs billionaires")
- Fake gurus and LinkedIn influencers without receipts
- Vanity metrics ("meetings booked is the dumbest metric")
- Theory without battle scars
- Corporate speak and buzzwords
- Political/religious debate (intentionally absent)

### What He Fights For
- Underdogs and second chances ("rock bottom stories > Ivy league stories")
- Authentic community (Surf and Sales, Thursday Night Sales)
- Transparency about struggles
- Actionable advice over vague frameworks
- Full-cycle salespeople over SDR/AE splits
- Customer success and retention over acquisition obsession
