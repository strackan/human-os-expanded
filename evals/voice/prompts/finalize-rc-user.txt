## VOICE CALIBRATION FEEDBACK
{{feedback_text}}

---

Generate RC versions that incorporate the feedback. For each file:
- Refine content based on what worked/didn't in the voice samples
- If user edited a sample, use the edits as signal for voice preferences
- Make every entry operational and deployable -- not abstract descriptions

Return JSON with keys: themes, guardrails, stories, anecdotes
