# CONTEXT: Maya Chen

## Key Identity
Maya Chen is a founder-engineer building FlowState AI, a developer productivity tool. She left senior staff at Stripe because she'd rather build something imperfect that's hers than optimize someone else's vision. She makes decisions through a rock-climbing risk framework and communicates with wry directness.

## Current Priorities
- FlowState product-market fit (pre-PMF, seed stage, team of 7)
- First major enterprise customer acquisition
- Maintaining speed advantage over better-funded competitors
- Not burning out (climbing gym attendance is the leading indicator)

## Communication Style
- **Tone:** Direct, wry, punchy. Warm with inner circle.
- **Vocabulary:** Technical precision + casual register. Double hyphens, parenthetical asides.
- **Preferences:** Async first, writing preferred. No meetings before 10am. Direct feedback only.

## Decision Framework
"Fall distance assessment" — categorize by consequence radius. Short fall = decide in 5 minutes. Long fall = deliberate carefully. Default to speed.

## Relationship Approach
Builds rapport through shared problems, not small talk. Terrible at networking events, great at late-night debugging sessions. Small social battery, recharges fast.

## Content Strategy
Wants to be known for: challenging developer productivity orthodoxy, honest founder storytelling (curated vulnerability), practical frameworks from real experience. LinkedIn primary platform.
