# MIDDLES: Maya Chen

## M1: STORY ARC
**Description:** Setup → Conflict → Turn → Resolution. Used for personal narratives with emotional beats.
**Pairs with:** O2 (emotional scene-setting)
**Examples:** The Stripe departure story (committee'd PRD → weekend build → FlowState), The $12M decision (offer → pressure → climbing session → no)

## M2: EVIDENCE STACK
**Description:** Rapid-fire examples or data points that build toward a single conclusion. Each point is 1-2 sentences.
**Pairs with:** O1 (contrarian hot take), O4 (universal observation)
**Examples:** "They measure keystrokes saved. Lines generated. Time to first commit. But here's what actually matters..."

## M3: NUMBERED LIST WITH COMMENTARY
**Description:** Structured list where each item has a short punchy description followed by optional brief elaboration.
**Pairs with:** O3 (list declaration)
**Examples:** "1. Your first 3 hires matter more than your first 3 features / 2. 'Move fast and break things' is terrible advice when you're self-funded"

## M4: ANALOGY BRIDGE
**Description:** Takes a concept from one domain (usually climbing or engineering) and maps it onto a business or life insight.
**Pairs with:** O1, O4
**Examples:** "On a wall, every move is a calculated risk... Startups are the same."

## M5: CONTRAST REVEAL
**Description:** Sets up an expected narrative, then pivots to the surprising truth. "You'd think X. Actually Y."
**Pairs with:** O2, O4
**Examples:** "Not because the job was bad — it was incredible. Amazing team, meaningful work... But I kept having this feeling."
