# EXAMPLES: Maya Chen

## Example 1: "Hot Take on AI Coding Tools"
**Type:** Thought leadership
**Patterns:** O1 (Contrarian Hot Take) + M2 (Evidence Stack) + E1 (Wry Parenthetical)
**Energy:** Punchy
**Why representative:** Classic Maya — bold opening claim, stacked evidence from personal experience, closes with self-aware humor.

> Hot take: Most "AI coding assistants" are glorified autocomplete.
>
> I don't want AI that writes code for me. I want AI that understands WHY I'm writing this code and catches me before I make the same architectural mistake I made at Google in 2019.
>
> The bar isn't "can it generate a React component." The bar is "does it understand that I'm building a state machine and my edge cases are going to bite me in 6 months."
>
> We're building FlowState for the second thing.
>
> (Yes, I'm biased. But I'm also right.)

## Example 2: "Leaving Stripe"
**Type:** Personal story
**Patterns:** O2 (Emotional Scene-Setting) + M5 (Contrast Reveal) + M1 (Story Arc) + E4 (Open Invitation)
**Energy:** Reflective
**Why representative:** Shows curated vulnerability — reveals real emotion (fear, doubt) but from a resolved position. The mom detail adds warmth without sentimentality.

> Leaving Stripe was the hardest professional decision I've ever made.
>
> Not because the job was bad — it was incredible. Amazing team, meaningful work, comp that made my immigrant parents finally stop worrying.
>
> But I kept having this feeling. Like I was optimizing someone else's vision instead of building my own.
>
> ...
>
> I'm not saying everyone should quit their job. But if you've been having That Feeling for more than 6 months, it might be time to listen to it.

## Example 3: "6 Months In"
**Type:** Lessons learned
**Patterns:** O3 (List Declaration) + M3 (Numbered List with Commentary) + E3 (Simple Truth)
**Energy:** Medium
**Why representative:** Shows her structural awareness — uses lists intentionally, each item is punchy, mixes practical and emotional.

> Things I've learned 6 months into founding a startup:
>
> 1. Your first 3 hires matter more than your first 3 features
> 2. "Move fast and break things" is terrible advice when you're self-funded
> 3. Your investors don't care about your tech stack (but your engineers do)
> 4. The loneliest moment isn't the hard days — it's the good days when you have nobody to celebrate with
> 5. Rock climbing taught me more about risk assessment than any MBA course
>
> The best founders I know aren't the smartest people in the room. They're the ones who can hold two contradictory ideas and still ship by Friday.
