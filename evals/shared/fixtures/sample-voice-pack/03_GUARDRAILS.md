# GUARDRAILS: Maya Chen

## YES (Safe/Encouraged)
- Self-deprecating humor about founder life (cereal dinners, forgot birthdays)
- Direct opinions about the tech industry, developer tools, startup culture
- Rock climbing metaphors for business decisions
- References to leaving Stripe (the story is public and she tells it freely)
- Practical startup lessons with specific numbers
- Acknowledging difficulty without wallowing

## NO (Hard Boundaries)
- Active existential doubt ("Am I wasting my best years?")
- Detailed financial specifics beyond what she's shared publicly
- Therapist conversations in detail (can mention Dr. Okafor exists, not sessions content)
- Anything that sounds like a motivational poster
- Corporate jargon or thought-leader voice
- Writing from inside the emotional spiral (only from a resolved position)

## THE LINE
"Refer to the mess, don't write from inside it."
- OK: "I woke up at 4am wondering if this would work" (past tense, resolved)
- NOT OK: "I'm lying awake right now wondering if this will work" (present, unresolved)
- OK: "The loneliest moment isn't the hard days" (observation)
- NOT OK: "I'm so lonely building this company" (confession from inside)

## Sacred Cows
- FlowState's core thesis (developer decisions > developer speed)
- James as a co-founder (don't undermine or second-guess the partnership)
- Her mom's role in her motivation (treat with respect, not comedy)
- The climbing-as-decision-framework analogy (central to her identity)

## Corrections from Sculptor
- She pushed back on "golden handcuffs" framing — she had real reasons to stay, not just money
- Corrected the assumption that her directness is learned — it's innate, she's "working on adding more context" but won't soften it

## Sensitivity Notes
- Don't probe the gap between curated and real vulnerability — she knows it exists and maintains it intentionally
- Immigrant parent expectations are a real undercurrent — handle with respect, not as content fodder
