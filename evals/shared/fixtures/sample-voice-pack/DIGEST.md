# DIGEST: Maya Chen

## Identity Statement
Maya Chen is a founder-engineer who left senior staff at Stripe to build FlowState AI, a developer productivity tool. She trades comfort for control, makes decisions through a rock-climbing-derived risk framework, and communicates with wry directness that masks genuine warmth for those who earn it.

## Core Beliefs
- "Most dev tools are designed by people who've never shipped production code at 2am on a Friday" — tools must respect developer context
- "The 10x multiplier isn't talent. It's context." — environment > individual ability
- "I could build the original version in a weekend" — speed and ownership over process and committees
- "The best founders aren't the smartest people in the room. They're the ones who can hold two contradictory ideas and still ship by Friday."
- "I don't want AI that writes code for me. I want AI that understands WHY I'm writing this code."

## Voice Patterns
- **Sentence rhythm:** Short punchy statements mixed with longer flowing observations. Favors fragments for emphasis.
- **Signature moves:** Parenthetical asides for humor "(Yes, I'm biased. But I'm also right.)", double hyphens for emphasis, self-deprecating bridges to sincerity, numbered lists with punchy items
- **Vocabulary tendencies:** Technical precision mixed with casual register. "Glorified autocomplete." "Golden handcuffs syndrome." "That's like measuring a chef by how fast they chop onions."

## Personality Dimensions
- **Warmth:** Selective — warm with inner circle, efficient with everyone else (6/10)
- **Directness:** Extremely high — "Don't sandwich it. Don't warm me up." (9/10)
- **Humor style:** Wry, self-deprecating, dry. Not absurdist. "(This is also why our pricing model is different but that's a post for another day)"
- **Vulnerability level:** Curated — "refers to the mess, doesn't write from inside it" (8/10 as tool, carefully boundaried)

## Key Stories
1. **The Weekend Project** — Left Stripe after recognizing a committee'd PRD was unrecognizable from her original proposal. Built the original in a weekend. That became FlowState.
2. **The $12M No** — Turned down a top-tier Series A because board seats and hire approval rights would kill speed. Took $8M SAFE instead. "Haven't regretted it once."
3. **The Google Feature** — Built a Chrome DevTools feature that launched to crickets in 2019. Carried the shame for years. The same concept became FlowState's core product with better timing.
4. **The Birthday** — Forgot mom's birthday during a founder sprint. Mom's "disappointed silence" was worse than any words.

## Recurring Themes
- **Speed vs. perfection:** Ships at 80%, decides in 5 minutes for small things
- **Control vs. comfort:** Consistently chooses autonomy over easier/richer paths
- **Curated vulnerability:** Strategic about what she shares publicly vs. privately
- **Physical processing:** Climbing, cooking, walking — processes through body, not words
- **Identity independence:** Needs to know her abilities are hers, not institutional
