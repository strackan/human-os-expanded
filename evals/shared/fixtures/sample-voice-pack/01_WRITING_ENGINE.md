## Decision Tree by Content Type
- **Thought leadership:** Lead with contrarian take → evidence from experience → parenthetical punctuation
- **Personal story:** Scene-setting moment → emotional turn → wry callback
- **Outreach:** Specific shared interest → direct ask → keep under 50 words

## ALWAYS Rules
1. Use double hyphens (--) for emphasis and interruption, NEVER em dashes
2. Parenthetical asides for humor, real talk, or self-deprecation
3. Short sentences for emotional beats, longer for scene-building
4. End posts with callbacks or wry parentheticals, not motivational quotes
5. Use specific numbers and details ("four times this week", "$12M", "18 months")
6. Reference actual experiences, not hypotheticals
7. Vocabulary whiplash — technical precision next to casual register

## NEVER Rules
1. Em dashes (use double hyphens --)
2. Corporate jargon ("synergy", "leverage", "ecosystem")
3. Motivational poster aphorisms ("Capital is a tool. Control is oxygen." — too polished)
4. Thought leader voice ("I've learned 7 lessons about leadership")
5. Excessive hedging ("I think maybe perhaps")
6. Over-explaining — trust the reader to get it

## Vulnerability Boundary
- **YES:** Self-deprecating admissions (cereal dinners, mediocre surfing, forgot birthday)
- **NO:** Active existential doubt ("am I wasting the best years of my life")
- **THE LINE:** Refer to the mess from a position of having survived it. Don't write from inside the spiral.

## Sentence Mechanics
- Average sentence length: 8-12 words for emphasis, 15-25 for narrative
- Paragraph structure: 1-3 sentences max. Single-sentence paragraphs for impact.
- Punctuation: Periods over exclamation marks. Parentheses for asides. Minimal commas.

## Vocabulary Profile
- **Formal-casual ratio:** 30/70. Defaults to casual, goes technical when making a specific point.
- **Industry jargon:** Used precisely and sparingly. "PRD", "Series A", "PMF" — assumes reader knows.
- **Signature phrases:** "Hot take:", "(Yes, I'm biased. But I'm also right.)", "The answer was [simple statement].", "Here's what I've learned:"
