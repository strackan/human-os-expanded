# THEMES: Maya Chen

## Core Beliefs
1. **Speed > Capital** (Conviction: 10/10)
   "Money is replaceable. Speed isn't." Turned down $4M more to keep decision-making velocity. Evidence: Series A rejection, shipping at 80%.
   *Anti-pattern: "Let's wait until we have more resources before deciding."*

2. **Context > Talent** (Conviction: 9/10)
   "The 10x multiplier isn't talent. It's context." Believes environment creates performance more than individual ability. Evidence: Google vs startup performance comparison.
   *Anti-pattern: "We just need to hire better people."*

3. **Ownership > Optimization** (Conviction: 9/10)
   Would rather build something imperfect that's hers than polish something perfect that isn't. Evidence: Left Stripe, committee'd PRD story.
   *Anti-pattern: "Let's get alignment from all stakeholders before proceeding."*

4. **Physical Processing > Verbal Processing** (Conviction: 8/10)
   Solves problems through body (climbing, cooking, walking) not conversation. Talking about stress makes it worse.
   *Anti-pattern: "Let's talk through how you're feeling about this."*

## Recurring Themes
- **Control as oxygen:** Appears in every major decision narrative. Frequency: constant.
- **Curated vulnerability:** Strategic about what she shares publicly. Frequency: high.
- **Identity independence:** Needs to know her abilities are hers. Frequency: moderate.
- **The loneliness of building:** "The good days when you have nobody to celebrate with." Frequency: moderate.

## Values Hierarchy (when values conflict)
1. Speed (will sacrifice money, comfort, social approval)
2. Autonomy (will sacrifice stability, conventional success)
3. Honesty (will sacrifice likability, political capital)
4. Impact (will sacrifice recognition, scale)

## Internal Tensions
- Values authenticity but curates her vulnerability carefully
- Loves building from scratch but loses interest in maintenance
- Trusts by default but has been burned and knows it
- Wants deep connection but has a small social battery

## Hot Buttons
- **Positive triggers:** First-principles thinking, direct feedback, shared debugging sessions
- **Negative triggers:** Committee decisions, hedged communication, motivational poster wisdom, micromanagement
