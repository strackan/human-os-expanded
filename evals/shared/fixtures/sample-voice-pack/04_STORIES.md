# STORIES: Maya Chen

## S1: The Committee'd PRD
**Summary:** Maya proposed a feature at Stripe that went through 4 committee reviews and 2 reorgs over 18 months, emerging unrecognizable. She realized she could build the original in a weekend — and did. That became FlowState.
**Core Quote:** "I was reviewing a PRD for a feature I'd proposed 18 months earlier. It had been through 4 committee reviews, 2 reorgs, and emerged as something I barely recognized."
**Emotional Tone:** Frustration → clarity → determination
**Vulnerability Level:** Medium
**Tags:** identity, ownership, speed, founding-story
**Use Cases:** Inspiration, credibility, "why I started this company"

## S2: The $12M No
**Summary:** Turned down a $12M Series A from a top-tier firm because the terms included a board seat and hire approval rights. Took $8M SAFE instead, with full control. Advisor said she'd regret it.
**Core Quote:** "My advisor literally said 'You're going to regret this.' I haven't regretted it once."
**Emotional Tone:** Conviction, quiet defiance
**Vulnerability Level:** Low
**Tags:** decision-making, control, speed, risk
**Use Cases:** Credibility, decision frameworks, contrarian takes

## S3: The Google Feature Reborn
**Summary:** Built a Chrome DevTools feature at Google in 2019 that launched to crickets. Carried the shame for years. The same concept, rebuilt with better timing and context, became FlowState's core product.
**Core Quote:** "Sometimes the best ideas have the worst timing."
**Emotional Tone:** Shame → redemption → vindication
**Vulnerability Level:** Medium-high
**Tags:** failure, timing, resilience, identity
**Use Cases:** Inspiration, vulnerability, "failure isn't final"

## S4: The Forgotten Birthday
**Summary:** Forgot her mom's birthday during an intense founder sprint. Mom said nothing (worse than anger). Sent flowers the next day with a note: "I'm building something that will make you proud, and also I'm sorry I'm terrible." Mom texted back a heart emoji.
**Core Quote:** "My mom is the queen of disappointed silence."
**Emotional Tone:** Guilt → tenderness → humor
**Vulnerability Level:** Medium
**Tags:** personal life, family, founder-sacrifice, humor
**Use Cases:** Connection, relatability, curated vulnerability

## S5: The First Customer
**Summary:** James and Maya got their first paying customer — a 3-person startup in Austin paying $49/month. Maya cried in a Starbucks parking lot. Not because of the money — because someone they'd never met chose to trust something they built.
**Core Quote:** "That feeling hasn't been replicated by any of the bigger wins since."
**Emotional Tone:** Joy, disbelief, gratitude
**Vulnerability Level:** High
**Tags:** founding-story, milestone, gratitude, meaning
**Use Cases:** Connection, inspiration, "what matters"
