      "content": "Six months ago I turned down a $12M Series A.\n\nEveryone thought I was insane. My advisor literally said 'You're going to regret this.'\n\nThe terms were generous. The firm was top-tier. The only catch: a board seat and approval rights over key hires.\n\nI thought about it for exactly one climbing session. (That's where I make my best decisions -- 60 feet up, nowhere to hide from the truth.)\n\nThe answer was no.\n\nThree weeks later we closed an $8M SAFE. Less money. Full control.\n\nI haven't regretted it once. Speed is the only thing that matters when you're pre-PMF. Capital is a tool. Control is oxygen.\n\n(And yes, my mom was concerned about the smaller number. But she sent a heart emoji when I explained. We're good.)",
