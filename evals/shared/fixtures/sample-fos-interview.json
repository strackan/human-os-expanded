    "a1": "My turning point was leaving Stripe. I'd been there three years, had the title, the comp, the team. But I kept building features I didn't believe in. The moment I knew was reviewing a PRD for something I'd proposed 18 months earlier -- it had been committee'd into something unrecognizable. I thought 'I could build the original in a weekend.' That weekend project became FlowState. The fear wasn't failing. The fear was finding out I wasn't as good as Stripe made me look.",
    "a2": "Happiest memory is the day James and I got our first paying customer. It was a 3-person startup in Austin. They paid $49/month. I cried in a Starbucks parking lot. Not because of the money -- because someone we'd never met chose to trust something we built. That feeling hasn't been replicated by any of the bigger wins since.",
    "a3": "Hardest time was the first three months after leaving Stripe. I went from managing a team of 12 to sitting alone in my apartment with a blank VS Code window. The silence was deafening. I started doubting everything. My therapist Dr. Okafor helped me see that my perfectionism was really about control -- once I let go of needing everything to be perfect before shipping, things started moving.",
    "a4": "Redemption story: I failed spectacularly at Google in 2019. Built a feature for Chrome DevTools that I was sure would be huge. Spent 6 months on it. Launched to crickets. My skip-level said 'Sometimes the best ideas have the worst timing.' I carried that shame for years. Then at FlowState, I basically rebuilt the same concept with better timing and market fit. That 'failed' feature at Google IS our core product now. The lesson: ideas don't expire, contexts change.",
    "b1": "I process decisions through what I call 'fall distance assessment' from rock climbing. Every decision has a consequence radius. Small fall distance (wrong button color) -- decide in 5 minutes. Long fall distance (wrong hire) -- take time, check gear, verify belayer. Most founders treat every decision like a 60-foot fall. That's why they move slowly.",
    "b2": "Example: Turning down a $12M Series A to take an $8M SAFE. Less money, full control. Everyone thought I was crazy. My advisor literally said 'You'll regret this.' Haven't regretted it once. Speed > capital when you're pre-product-market-fit.",
    "b3": "Most important relationships: James (co-founder) is my professional opposite -- spreadsheets where I have gut feelings. We fight about everything and agree on what matters. Dr. Okafor (therapist) helped me untangle perfectionism from control. My mom is the queen of disappointed silence -- motivates me more than any investor pitch.",
    "b4": "I recharge by climbing. Not metaphorical climbing -- actual rock faces. Something about the physical problem-solving resets my brain. Also: cooking elaborate meals for exactly one person (me). It's meditative. And honestly, scrolling Twitter at 11pm, which I know is bad but it's my vice.",
    "c1": "Work style: I'm a sprinter, not a marathoner. I do my best work in 3-4 hour intense blocks. After that, I'm useless and should stop pretending otherwise. I need at least one block of deep work before any meetings. Meetings before 10am should be illegal.",
    "c2": "When I'm stuck, I need someone to ask me the question I'm avoiding, not give me the answer. James is good at this -- he'll say 'What are you actually afraid of here?' and that usually unlocks it. I don't need cheerleading. I need someone to be honest with me even when it's uncomfortable.",
    "c3": "Feedback preference: Direct. Don't sandwich it. Don't warm me up. If something's wrong, tell me what's wrong and let me fix it. The worst thing someone can do is hint at a problem and make me guess. I'd rather hear 'This approach won't work because X' than 'Have you considered maybe possibly thinking about X?'",
    "c4": "I build rapport through shared problems, not small talk. If you and I are both struggling with the same technical challenge or business problem, we're bonded for life. I'm terrible at networking events but great at 'let's debug this together at 11pm' relationships.",
    "c5": "Ideal AI support: Don't be a yes-person. I have enough of those. I want an AI that pushes back when my logic is shaky, remembers that I always overcommit in Q1, and tells me 'You said you'd stop scheduling meetings before 10am' when I'm about to do it again. Basically: be the honest friend I don't have enough of."

    "E01": "I'm most energized when I'm building something from scratch. The blank page doesn't scare me -- it excites me.",
    "E02": "I'm least energized by maintenance work and operations. Once something is built and running, I lose interest fast.",
    "E03": "My morning routine: wake at 6, coffee, 30 min of reading (usually technical blogs or philosophy), then deep work until 10. No phone until after first coffee.",
    "E04": "I get overwhelmed when there are more than 3 critical decisions pending simultaneously. My brain starts context-switching and nothing gets my full attention.",
    "E05": "My biggest blind spot is underestimating how long other people need to process change. I move fast and expect everyone to keep up.",
    "E06": "When I procrastinate, it's usually because I'm afraid the output won't be good enough. Classic perfectionism.",
    "E07": "I need approximately zero meetings per day to be happy. Every meeting is a context switch that costs me 30 minutes of recovery.",
    "E08": "I communicate best in writing. Async by default, sync when something is emotionally charged or genuinely complex.",
    "E09": "I know I'm burnt out when I start canceling social plans. The climbing gym is always the first thing to go.",
    "E10": "The best manager I ever had let me own my domain completely and only intervened when I asked. Micromanagement is my kryptonite.",
    "E11": "I make my best decisions in the morning. Never let me make a strategic decision after 3pm.",
    "E12": "My relationship with money: it's a tool, not a scoreboard. I turned down $4M more to keep control of my company. That should tell you everything.",
    "E13": "I handle conflict directly but I need 10 minutes to process before I respond. Hot takes from me are usually wrong.",
    "E14": "I'm motivated by impact, not recognition. I'd rather build something 1000 people love than something 1M people have heard of.",
    "E15": "My social battery is small but it recharges fast. 2 hours of quality social time > 8 hours of networking.",
    "E16": "I learn by doing, not by studying. Give me the API docs and a sandbox, not a course.",
    "E17": "Physical health directly impacts my mental performance. If I haven't climbed in a week, my decision quality noticeably drops.",
    "E18": "I trust people by default and adjust from there. This has burned me exactly twice in my career.",
    "E19": "My biggest fear is mediocrity. Not failure -- failure teaches you something. Mediocrity just... exists.",
    "E20": "I define success as: did I build something that mattered to people I respect?",
    "E21": "When giving feedback, I'm direct to a fault. I'm working on adding more context before the critique.",
    "E22": "I process stress physically -- through climbing, cooking, walking. Talking about stress makes it worse for me.",
    "E23": "The thing I most wish people understood about me: my intensity isn't aggression. It's passion that hasn't learned to modulate.",
    "E24": "In 5 years I want to be running a company that people join because the work matters, not because of the brand name."
