**Maya Chen** — Founder & CEO at FlowState AI | Building the future of developer productivity

### About
I build tools that respect developers' time. After 8 years at Google and a stint at Stripe, I realized most dev tools are designed by people who've never shipped production code at 2am on a Friday. FlowState is different — we build for the developer who's already tried everything else.

Former competitive rock climber. Current mediocre surfer. Permanent overthinker.

### Experience
- **Founder & CEO** — FlowState AI (2024–present)
  Building AI-powered developer productivity tools. Seed stage, team of 7.

- **Senior Staff Engineer** — Stripe (2021–2024)
  Led the Developer Experience team. Shipped Stripe CLI v2, reduced onboarding time by 40%.

- **Staff Software Engineer** — Google (2016–2021)
  Chrome DevTools team. Built the Performance panel redesign used by 2M+ developers monthly.

Hot take: Most "AI coding assistants" are glorified autocomplete.

I don't want AI that writes code for me. I want AI that understands WHY I'm writing this code and catches me before I make the same architectural mistake I made at Google in 2019.

The bar isn't "can it generate a React component." The bar is "does it understand that I'm building a state machine and my edge cases are going to bite me in 6 months."

We're building FlowState for the second thing.

(Yes, I'm biased. But I'm also right.)

Leaving Stripe was the hardest professional decision I've ever made.

Not because the job was bad — it was incredible. Amazing team, meaningful work, comp that made my immigrant parents finally stop worrying.

But I kept having this feeling. Like I was optimizing someone else's vision instead of building my own.

My therapist called it "golden handcuffs syndrome." I called it Tuesday.

The moment I knew: I was reviewing a PRD for a feature I'd proposed 18 months earlier. It had been through 4 committee reviews, 2 reorgs, and emerged as something I barely recognized. I thought: "I could build the original version in a weekend."

So I did. That weekend project became FlowState.

I'm not saying everyone should quit their job. But if you've been having That Feeling for more than 6 months, it might be time to listen to it.

### Post 3 (2 months ago)
Things I've learned 6 months into founding a startup:

1. Your first 3 hires matter more than your first 3 features
2. "Move fast and break things" is terrible advice when you're self-funded
3. Your investors don't care about your tech stack (but your engineers do)
4. The loneliest moment isn't the hard days — it's the good days when you have nobody to celebrate with
5. Rock climbing taught me more about risk assessment than any MBA course

The best founders I know aren't the smartest people in the room. They're the ones who can hold two contradictory ideas and still ship by Friday.

### Post 4 (3 months ago)
Quick thread on why I think developer productivity tools are broken:

The industry optimizes for LINES OF CODE per hour. That's like measuring a chef by how fast they chop onions.

What matters is: did the developer ship the RIGHT thing? Did they avoid the rabbit hole? Did they catch the production issue before it became a 3am page?

At FlowState, we measure "decisions made correctly" not "keystrokes saved."

(This is also why our pricing model is different but that's a post for another day)

### "The Myth of 10x Developers" (personal blog)
Everyone wants to hire a 10x developer. Nobody wants to create 10x conditions.

I've been the "10x developer" and I've managed them. Here's what I've learned: the 10x multiplier isn't talent. It's context.

Give a great developer unclear requirements, a codebase with no tests, and a PM who changes priorities weekly — they'll perform at 0.5x. Give an average developer clear ownership, good tooling, and psychological safety — they'll surprise you.

The best engineering leaders I know don't hire for talent. They hire for curiosity and then create conditions where curiosity compounds.
