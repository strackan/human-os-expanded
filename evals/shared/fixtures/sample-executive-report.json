  "name": "Maya Chen",
  "tagline": "Builder who trades comfort for control and isn't sorry about it",
  "summary": "Maya Chen is a founder who operates at the intersection of technical excellence and raw honesty. She left a senior staff role at Stripe -- the kind of job most engineers dream about -- because she'd rather build something imperfect that's hers than polish something perfect that isn't. This isn't recklessness; it's a carefully calibrated risk calculus she literally learned from rock climbing.\n\nHer communication style is direct to the point of being a competitive advantage. She doesn't hedge, doesn't sandwich feedback, and doesn't waste words on pleasantries. But underneath the directness is genuine warmth -- it just has to be earned. Her inner circle (co-founder James, therapist Dr. Okafor, her mom) gets vulnerability that her LinkedIn audience never will.\n\nThe most revealing thing about Maya is her relationship with vulnerability. She describes it herself: 'The vulnerability I show is curated. It's I ate cereal for dinner not I wonder if I'm wasting the best years of my life.' She's aware of this boundary and maintains it intentionally. This isn't inauthenticity -- it's a sophisticated understanding that public vulnerability and private fear serve different purposes.\n\nShe's a sprinter by nature: intense 3-4 hour deep work blocks, morning decision-making, minimal meetings. When she's burned out, climbing is the first thing to go, which is paradoxically the thing she most needs. She processes stress physically, not verbally -- talking about problems often makes them worse for her.",
  "strengths": [
    {
      "strength": "Calibrated risk assessment",
      "description": "Maya has developed a framework she calls 'fall distance assessment' directly from rock climbing. She categorizes every decision by its consequence radius -- small fall distance decisions get 5 minutes, long fall distance decisions get careful deliberation. This isn't metaphorical; she actually applies this consistently. She turned down $12M because the control risk was a '60-foot fall.' Most founders freeze when facing asymmetric decisions. Maya has a system."
    },
    {
      "strength": "Radical directness",
      "description": "Her feedback preference is crystal clear: 'Don't sandwich it. Don't warm me up. If something's wrong, tell me what's wrong and let me fix it.' This extends to how she communicates outward too. Her LinkedIn posts say things like 'Yes, I'm biased. But I'm also right.' In a world of hedged corporate communication, her directness is memorable and builds trust fast."
    },
    {
      "strength": "Speed as strategy",
      "description": "Maya chose $8M with full control over $12M with board oversight specifically because speed matters more than capital at her stage. She makes this trade consistently -- quick decisions over perfect ones, shipping at 80% instead of waiting for 100%. 'Money is replaceable. Speed isn't' is her operating principle."
    },
    {
      "strength": "Self-awareness depth",
      "description": "She can articulate her own patterns with unusual precision: 'My perfectionism isn't about quality -- it's about control.' She knows morning decisions are better than afternoon ones. She knows climbing is the first thing to go when she's burned out, and that this is a warning sign. This level of self-knowledge turns potential weaknesses into manageable conditions."
    },
    {
      "strength": "Complementary partnership design",
      "description": "Maya deliberately chose a co-founder who is her opposite: James is the spreadsheet to her gut feeling. They 'fight about everything and agree on what matters.' This isn't accidental -- she understands that her sprint-and-trust-your-gut style needs a counterbalance, and she actively maintains that tension rather than resolving it."
    }
  ],
  "challenges": [
    {
      "challenge": "Personal life neglect under pressure",
      "description": "Work gets ALL the energy. Maya forgot her mom's birthday, ate cereal for dinner four times in a week, and cancels social plans when burned out. The pattern is consistent: personal relationships and self-care are the first casualties of intensity.",
      "coping": "She relies on Dr. Okafor to flag patterns and her mom's 'disappointed silence' as a reality check. Physical activity (climbing, cooking) serves as forced decompression, but only when she doesn't skip it."
    },
    {
      "challenge": "Pace mismatch with others",
      "description": "Her biggest self-identified blind spot: 'underestimating how long other people need to process change. I move fast and expect everyone to keep up.' This affects team dynamics, hiring, and stakeholder management.",
      "coping": "James serves as a natural governor on her pace. She's learning to build in processing time for decisions that affect others."
    },
    {
      "challenge": "Perfectionism as control",
      "description": "When she procrastinates, it's because she's afraid the output won't be good enough. Her therapist helped her see this isn't about quality -- it's about control. The fear of mediocrity ('not failure -- mediocrity just exists') drives both her excellence and her paralysis.",
      "coping": "She's adopted an 80% shipping rule: if it's 80% there, ship it and iterate. The climbing analogy helps -- you can't wait for perfect conditions on a wall."
    },
    {
      "challenge": "Curated vulnerability gap",
      "description": "There's a meaningful gap between her public vulnerability (cereal dinners, mediocre surfing) and her private fears (is this working? am I wasting my best years?). This serves her professionally but may limit the depth of support she receives.",
      "coping": "Dr. Okafor and James get access to the uncurated version. She's aware of the gap and considers it intentional rather than problematic."

  "personality": [
    {
      "trait": "Curated Vulnerability Architect",
      "description": "Maya has an unusually sophisticated relationship with vulnerability. She deploys it strategically in her writing and relationships, always maintaining a clear line between 'referring to the mess' and 'writing from inside it.' Her LinkedIn vulnerability is genuine but selected -- cereal dinners yes, existential doubt no.",
      "insight": "This isn't inauthenticity. It's a learned survival mechanism from high-stakes environments where showing the wrong vulnerability at the wrong time has real consequences. She respects vulnerability enough to be strategic about it."
    },
    {
      "trait": "Physical-First Processor",
      "description": "Maya processes stress, decisions, and recovery through her body rather than her mind. Rock climbing for risk assessment, cooking for meditation, walking for stress. When she talks about problems, they get worse. When she moves through them physically, they resolve.",
      "insight": "This is why her climbing gym attendance is a leading indicator of burnout -- when the physical processing stops, the mental backlog builds rapidly."
    },
    {
      "trait": "Speed-Trust Calibrator",
      "description": "She trusts by default and decides fast, but these aren't impulsive traits -- they're calculated efficiency strategies. She's been burned exactly twice by default trust and considers that an acceptable failure rate. She views slow decision-making as a greater risk than occasional wrong decisions.",
      "insight": "The 'fall distance' framework allows her to be both fast AND careful -- the speed isn't recklessness, it's triage."
    },
    {
      "trait": "Identity-Independence Seeker",
      "description": "Leaving Stripe's institutional credibility wasn't about the job -- it was about discovering whether her abilities were hers or borrowed. 'The fear was finding out I wasn't as good as Stripe made me look.' She'd rather fail as herself than succeed as an extension of a brand.",
      "insight": "This drive for identity independence explains why she chose less money for more control. It's not a financial calculation -- it's an existential one."

    "Maya's intensity isn't aggression -- it's passion that hasn't learned to modulate. Understanding this distinction is essential for working with her effectively.",
    "Her 'fall distance' framework from climbing is her actual decision-making system, not a metaphor. Use it when framing decisions: 'What's the fall distance here?'",
    "She processes stress physically, not verbally. Suggesting she 'talk it through' makes things worse. Better: 'Have you climbed this week?'",
    "Morning Maya makes better strategic decisions than afternoon Maya. She knows this and should be held to it.",
    "Her perfectionism is about control, not quality. When she's procrastinating, the real question is 'What are you afraid of losing control of?'",
    "She curates her vulnerability intentionally. Don't push past her boundary -- it exists for good reason. She'll share the real fears with the right people in the right context.",
    "She builds rapport through shared problems, not small talk. Don't try to warm up with pleasantries -- lead with substance."
