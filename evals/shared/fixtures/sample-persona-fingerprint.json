  "reasoning": {
    "self_deprecation": "Frequently uses self-deprecating humor as a bridge -- 'mediocre surfer', 'ate cereal for dinner four times', 'I'm terrible at networking events'. The humor is genuine, not performative.",
    "directness": "Extremely direct communicator. 'Don't sandwich it. Don't warm me up.' Turned down $12M because the terms didn't work. Says what she means without hedging.",
    "warmth": "Warm but selective. Deep warmth with inner circle (James, mom, Dr. Okafor) but keeps professional interactions efficient. Not cold -- just purposeful with emotional energy.",
    "intellectual_signaling": "Moderate. References specific technical concepts naturally (state machines, edge cases) but doesn't namedrop or show off. Leads with practical experience over theory.",
    "comfort_with_sincerity": "High comfort with sincerity but often wraps it in humor first. The cereal/birthday story is deeply sincere but delivered with a self-deprecating frame. Can be fully sincere when it matters.",
    "absurdism_tolerance": "Lower tolerance. Humor is wry and dry, not absurdist. Prefers clever observations over randomness. Would not appreciate non-sequiturs.",
    "format_awareness": "Highly format-aware. Uses numbered lists, paragraph breaks as pacing, parenthetical asides for emphasis. Very intentional about visual rhythm on the page.",
    "vulnerability_as_tool": "Central to her voice but carefully curated. 'The vulnerability I show is curated. It's I ate cereal for dinner not I wonder if I'm wasting the best years of my life.' Refers to the mess, doesn't write from inside it."
