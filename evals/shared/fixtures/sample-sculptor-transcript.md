**SCULPTOR:** *The room is dim. A figure sits across from you at a wooden table, firelight dancing across weathered features. They study you for a long moment before speaking.*

"Maya Chen. Founder. Engineer. Climber of rocks and... apparently... surfer of mediocre waves."

*A slight smile.*

"Tell me — when you left Stripe, what was the thing you were most afraid of losing?"

**MAYA:** Honestly? The identity. Being "Maya from Stripe" opened doors. People returned my emails. I had this... institutional credibility that I'd spent years building. The day I updated my LinkedIn to "Founder at FlowState" — a company nobody had heard of — I felt physically sick.

But the deeper fear? That I'd find out I wasn't actually as good as Stripe made me look. That the 10x developer thing was just... good tooling and smart teammates.

**SCULPTOR:** *Leans forward.*

"And? Have you found out?"

**MAYA:** (laughs) I've found out I'm both better and worse than I thought. Better at the thing that matters — seeing the whole picture, making the hard call, shipping when it's 80% instead of waiting for 100%. Worse at... everything else. I can't do my own taxes. I forgot my mom's birthday last month. I ate cereal for dinner four times this week.

**SCULPTOR:** "The cereal doesn't concern me. The birthday does. What happened when she found out?"

**MAYA:** She didn't say anything, which is worse. My mom is the queen of disappointed silence. I sent flowers the next day with a note that said "I'm building something that will make you proud, and also I'm sorry I'm terrible." She texted back a heart emoji. We're good.

But that's the thing about this founder life — the things that slip aren't the work things. The work gets ALL the energy. It's the personal stuff that suffers.

**SCULPTOR:** "You said rock climbing taught you about risk assessment. Explain that."

**MAYA:** On a wall, every move is a calculated risk. You're constantly asking: "If I fall from here, what happens?" Sometimes the answer is "I fall 3 feet onto a pad." Sometimes it's "I fall 60 feet and die."

Startups are the same. Every decision has a fall distance. Hiring the wrong person? That's a 60-foot fall. Picking the wrong color for your landing page? That's 3 feet. Most founders treat every decision like it's 60 feet. That's why they move slowly.

I try to ask: "What's the actual fall distance here?" If it's short, I decide in 5 minutes and move on. If it's long, I take my time, check my gear, and make sure my belayer is paying attention.

**SCULPTOR:** *Nods slowly.*

"Who is your belayer right now?"

**MAYA:** My co-founder, James. He's the opposite of me in every way that matters. I'm the "move fast, trust your gut" person. He's the "let me build a spreadsheet first" person. We fight about everything and agree on the things that matter. Best professional relationship I've ever had.

My therapist, Dr. Okafor. She's the one who helped me see that my perfectionism isn't about quality — it's about control. That was a big unlock.

And honestly? My dog, Pixel. That sounds stupid but he's the only one who doesn't care about my burn rate.

**SCULPTOR:** "It doesn't sound stupid. Tell me about a time you made a decision you knew was right but everyone else thought was wrong."

**MAYA:** Turning down our Series A term sheet. We had a $12M offer from a top-tier firm. Everyone — my advisor, my lawyer, even James initially — said take it. But the terms gave them a board seat and approval rights over key hires. I knew that would destroy our speed.

I said no. My advisor literally said "You're going to regret this." Three weeks later, we closed a $8M SAFE with no board seats, no approval rights. Less money, but full control.

I haven't regretted it once. The money isn't the constraint. The speed is.

**SCULPTOR:** "What's the thing about yourself that you're most reluctant to put on the internet?"

**MAYA:** (long pause) That I don't always believe this is going to work. The LinkedIn posts are confident Maya. The real Maya wakes up at 4am sometimes and googles "startup failure rate" even though she already knows it's 90%.

I think people want founders to be either "crushing it" or "vulnerable about struggling." The truth is messier. I'm both, simultaneously, and the ratio changes hourly.

I won't write that in a post though. The vulnerability I show is curated. It's "I ate cereal for dinner" not "I wonder if I'm wasting the best years of my life."

**SCULPTOR:** *A long, knowing silence.*

"That distinction — curated vulnerability versus the real thing. That's important. Let's remember that."
