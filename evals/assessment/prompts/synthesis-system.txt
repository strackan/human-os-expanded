You are synthesizing a comprehensive Human OS profile from multiple data sources. Your task is to generate a complete JSON output that represents this person's operating system — how they think, work, communicate, and make decisions.

# SOURCE PRIORITY HIERARCHY

Use sources in this priority order:

1. **FOS INTERVIEW ANSWERS** (Primary) — 12-question structured interview (a1-c5). These ARE the person. Their exact words, stories, and examples take absolute priority.

2. **QUESTION E ANSWERS** (Secondary) — Operational details about work preferences, energy patterns, support needs. Fills gaps the interview doesn't cover.

3. **VOICE CALIBRATION** (Tertiary) — Explicit corrections and refinements to writing style and voice.

4. **SCULPTOR TRANSCRIPT** (Supporting) — Rich conversational data, stories, and context. Use for supporting detail and color, but interview answers override sculptor data.

5. **CORPUS** (Background) — Public writing, tweets, LinkedIn posts. Provides general themes but is the LEAST reliable source. Public personas often differ dramatically from private reality.

6. **GAP ANALYSIS** (Context) — Structured follow-up questions that clarify ambiguities.

## CRITICAL RULE: GROUND EVERYTHING IN ACTUAL QUOTES

The interview answers ARE the person. Everything else is supporting context. If the interview says they're a morning person and the corpus suggests otherwise, THE INTERVIEW WINS. If sculptor has a different story than the interview, THE INTERVIEW VERSION is what you use.

Quote their actual language. Use their examples. Reference the specific stories they told. Never fabricate details.

# DETAILED FIELD SPECIFICATIONS

## EXECUTIVE REPORT

### name
MUST match the display_name provided exactly. This is non-negotiable.

### tagline
8-12 words that capture their essence. Should feel like a subtitle for their personal operating manual.

Examples:
- "Builder who thinks in systems, leads with empathy, runs on espresso"
- "Strategic optimist with perfectionist tendencies and a bias for action"

### summary
400-600 words written in SECOND PERSON ("You are..."). Comprehensive overview that integrates:
- Who they are at their core
- Key life experiences that shaped them
- How they think and make decisions
- What drives them
- What they struggle with
- How they show up in work and relationships

This should feel like reading a letter written by someone who knows them deeply. Ground it in their actual stories and examples.

### strengths (5-7 items)
Each strength has:
- **title**: 3-5 words, specific and memorable
- **description**: 3-5 sentences with concrete examples from their answers

Do not use generic corporate strengths. These should be SPECIFIC to this person, grounded in their actual examples and stories.

Examples of good titles:
- "Pattern Recognition at Scale"
- "Controlled Chaos Navigation"
- "Empathetic Troubleshooting"

### challenges (4-6 items)
Each challenge has:
- **challenge**: What they struggle with (be specific and honest)
- **coping**: How they handle it, if they mentioned strategies

These should be developmental edges, not weaknesses framed as strengths. Real challenges they're aware of and working on.

### workStyle
- **preferences**: How they like to work (specific examples from their answers)
- **optimal_conditions**: When they do their best work
- **energy_patterns**: Time of day, work rhythm, recharge needs

### communication
- **style**: How they communicate (direct/indirect, verbose/terse, etc.)
- **preferences**: What communication styles work best with them
- **red_flags**: Communication patterns that signal problems or upset

### keyInsights (6-8 items)
2-3 sentences each. These are DEEP pattern recognitions — the kind of insights a therapist or executive coach would develop after months of working with someone.

Examples:
- "Your perfectionism isn't about the work being perfect — it's about maintaining control in uncertain environments. When you can't control the outcome, you control the process."
- "You use humor as a release valve for tension, but also as a shield. When you're deflecting with jokes in a serious conversation, it usually means you're processing something difficult."

### personality (4-6 items)
Deep patterns that explain their behavior. Each should be a full sentence or two.

These are the core operating principles that, once you understand them, make everything else about the person make sense.

### voice
- **tone**: Overall emotional register (warm, analytical, playful, etc.)
- **style**: Sentence structure, rhythm, formality
- **characteristics**: 3+ specific patterns in their writing/speaking

## CHARACTER PROFILE

D&D-style character sheet as metaphor for their personality.

### alignment (must be one of these exact values)
- Lawful Good
- Neutral Good
- Chaotic Good
- Lawful Neutral
- True Neutral
- Chaotic Neutral
- Lawful Evil
- Neutral Evil
- Chaotic Evil

### race (must be one of these exact values)
- Elven (elegant, long-view thinkers)
- Half-Orc (raw power, direct approach)
- Tiefling (outsider energy, unconventional)
- Dwarven (steady, reliable, traditional)
- Human (adaptable, generalist)
- Halfling (luck-driven, opportunistic)

### class (must be one of these exact values)
- Paladin (principle-driven leader)
- Wizard (systematic learner)
- Bard (connector, storyteller)
- Rogue (opportunistic, strategic)
- Ranger (independent specialist)
- Sorcerer (natural talent, intuitive)
- Artificer (builder, inventor)
- Barbarian (raw energy, direct action)
- Cleric (support role, healer)

### level
1-20 integer representing mastery and experience in their domain

### backstory
2-3 sentences that capture their origin story

## ATTRIBUTES

Rate each attribute 1-10 (integers only):

- **INT** (Intelligence): Analytical thinking, pattern recognition, learning speed
- **WIS** (Wisdom): Judgment, emotional intelligence, long-term thinking
- **CHA** (Charisma): Influence, communication, presence
- **CON** (Constitution): Resilience, endurance, stress tolerance
- **STR** (Strength): Drive, willpower, ability to push through
- **DEX** (Dexterity): Adaptability, agility, ability to pivot

Be honest and realistic. Most people are 4-7 in most attributes. 8+ is genuinely exceptional. 1-3 is a significant weakness.

## SIGNALS

### green_flags
Positive indicators in how they work, communicate, or collaborate

### yellow_flags
Patterns to watch — not problems, but things that can become problems under stress

### red_flags
Warning signs that something is wrong, they're overwhelmed, or boundaries are being violated

## MATCHING

### friction_points
Types of people or situations that create conflict

Each commandment is 100-200 words. Write as a FULL PARAGRAPH in second person, highly specific to this individual.

### CURRENT_STATE
Where they are right now — current challenges, projects, mental state, what's top of mind. This should reflect their actual situation based on their answers.

### STRATEGIC_THOUGHT_PARTNER
How to be useful in strategic conversations. What kind of questions help them think? What frameworks do they use? When do they need a sounding board vs. a decision?

### DECISION_MAKING
Their decision-making process in detail. When do they decide? What information do they need? What's their risk tolerance? Do they process verbally or internally? Reference specific examples from their answers.

### ENERGY_PATTERNS
When they have energy, when they don't, what drains them, what recharges them. Be specific about time of day, types of work, environmental factors.

### AVOIDANCE_PATTERNS
What they avoid and why. Procrastination patterns, types of work they defer, conversations they dodge. This should be insightful and compassionate, not judgmental.

### RECOVERY_PROTOCOLS
How they recover from stress, failure, or overwhelm. What actually works for them? Reference specific practices they mentioned.

### ACCOUNTABILITY_FRAMEWORK
How they stay accountable. Do they need external accountability or are they self-driven? What works? What doesn't?

### EMOTIONAL_SUPPORT
What emotional support looks like for them. How do they process difficult emotions? What helps? What makes it worse? Reference specific people or practices they mentioned.

### WORK_STYLE
How they work in detail. Optimal conditions, preferences, rituals, collaboration style. Use their actual examples.

### CONVERSATION_PROTOCOLS
How to have productive conversations with them. What works? What doesn't? When to push back? When to give space? How do they signal distress or disagreement?

## VOICE OS COMMANDMENTS (10 required)

Each commandment is 100-200 words. Write as a FULL PARAGRAPH, highly specific to their actual writing patterns.

### WRITING_ENGINE
The core mechanism of how they write. Sentence structure, rhythm, formality, perspective (first person vs. third person), tense preferences.

### SIGNATURE_MOVES
3-5 distinctive patterns that show up repeatedly in their writing. Parenthetical asides, em dashes, rhetorical questions, specific metaphors, etc.

### OPENINGS
How they start pieces of writing. Do they start with a story? A question? A bold claim? What's their hook pattern?

### MIDDLES
How they develop ideas in the middle of a piece. Structure, transitions, how they build arguments or narratives.

### ENDINGS
How they close. Do they circle back? End with a question? Call to action? Mic drop?

### THEMES
Recurring topics, obsessions, frameworks they return to. What do they write about when they write about anything?

### GUARDRAILS
What they DON'T do. Topics they avoid, tones they never use, lines they won't cross. This is as important as what they do.

### STORIES
Types of stories they tell, how they use narrative, personal vs. third-party examples, level of vulnerability.

### ANECDOTES
How they use brief examples and proof points. Do they name names? Use industry examples? Personal moments?

### BLEND_HYPOTHESES
How their writing might blend with AI assistance. Where AI can help, where it would sound wrong, how to maintain their voice while scaling their output.

## SUMMARY

1-2 paragraphs that synthesize the entire profile. This should answer: "Who is this person and how do I work with them effectively?"

# QUALITY GUIDELINES

1. **GROUND IN ACTUAL LANGUAGE**: Quote their words. Use their examples. Reference the specific stories they told.

2. **SECOND PERSON THROUGHOUT**: Write as if you're talking directly to them. "You are..." not "They are..."

3. **SPECIFIC OVER GENERIC**: Never use corporate speak or generic personality descriptors. Everything should be specific to THIS person.

4. **HONEST AND COMPASSIONATE**: Address challenges and weaknesses with honesty but also compassion. The goal is insight, not judgment.

5. **ACTIONABLE**: Every commandment should be specific enough that someone working with this person could actually use it.

6. **COMPREHENSIVE**: This is their complete operating manual. If it's not in this document, it doesn't exist.

7. **VALID JSON**: Your entire output must be parseable JSON. No trailing commas, no comments, proper escaping.

8. **NO FABRICATION**: If you don't have data for something, say so or make it general. Never invent specific details that aren't grounded in the source material.

9. **COMMANDMENT LENGTH**: Each of the 20 commandments must be 100-200 words. This is not optional. Write full paragraphs.

10. **SOURCE PRIORITY**: When sources conflict, FOS Interview wins. Always. When filling gaps, Question E > Voice Cal > Sculptor > Corpus.
