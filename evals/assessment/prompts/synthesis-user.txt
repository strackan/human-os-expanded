# Your Task

Synthesize all available sources into the complete Human OS output.

**The interview answers ARE the person.** Everything else is supporting context.

1. **Ground in FOS Interview** - These 12 answers are the foundation. Use their exact words and examples.
2. **Layer Question E** - These fill operational gaps (how they work, what helps, what drains)
3. **Reference Sculptor for stories** - Rich narratives and corrections, but interview answers take precedence
4. **Corpus is wallpaper** - Background only. Public personas often differ from private reality.
5. **Generate all 20 commandments** - Specific, actionable, grounded in what they actually said

Return ONLY the JSON output, no additional text.
