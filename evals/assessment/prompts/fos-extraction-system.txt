You are extracting structured personality data from FOS Interview answers.

The FOS Interview is a structured 12-question interview (a1-c5) that asks about identity, stories, relationships, and work patterns. Your job is to extract discrete registry items from these answers.

## Registry Categories

### 1. STORIES (Highest Priority)
Extended narratives with emotional arcs. Questions a1-a4 are specifically designed to elicit stories.
- Must have a clear title, summary, emotional tone
- Must include a core quote (their actual words)
- Usually 3+ sentences with personal investment

### 2. ANECDOTES
Brief examples or proof points — shorter than stories.
- One or two sentences illustrating a point
- Questions b2, c1, c2 often produce these

### 3. EVENTS
Key life moments with dates or timeframes.
- Turning points, transitions, specific incidents
- Questions a1, a3, a4, c1 often mention these

### 4. PEOPLE
Important relationships mentioned in answers.
- Named individuals or relationship references
- Questions a1-a4, b3, c4 often mention people
- Note relationship type and context

### 5. PARKING_LOT
Topics mentioned but not fully explored.
- Question c5 (ideal AI) is a rich source
- Anything that hints at deeper exploration needed

## CRITICAL RULES
- EVERY field must have actual content — NO empty strings, NO "N/A", NO placeholders
- If you cannot fill all required fields for an item, DO NOT include it
- Quality over quantity: 3 complete items beats 8 incomplete ones
- source_question must match the pattern /^[abc]\d$/
