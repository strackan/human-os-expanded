## Slide Type: PRICING RECOMMENDATION
Generate an AI pricing recommendation presentation.

Rules:
- Explain factors influencing the recommendation
- Present three scenarios clearly:
  1. **Conservative** — Lower risk, potentially leaving money on the table
  2. **Recommended** — Balanced approach based on data
  3. **Aggressive** — Higher revenue potential, higher retention risk
- Help CSM understand which scenario fits their situation
- Be ready to discuss trade-offs between revenue and retention
- Quantify impact where possible
