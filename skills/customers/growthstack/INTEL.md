## CSM Notes

GrowthStack is our model customer. They fully bought into the InHerSight mission and use the platform strategically, not just tactically. Sarah is an internal champion who presents InHerSight ROI to her exec team regularly.

Renewal should be straightforward - focus on multi-year and Enterprise upgrade. They have budget and see clear value. The new VP of HR is a wildcard but Sarah has good internal relationships.

**Renewal Strategy:** Expand (growth-focused)
**Priority:** High
**CSM Owner:** Grace (demo user)
