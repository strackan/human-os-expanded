# David Kim - Contact Intelligence

## Role & Influence

**Title:** HR Manager
**Department:** Human Resources
**Reports To:** Jennifer Walsh (CPO)
**Tenure:** 3 years at TechCorp

David is the operational HR lead who handles day-to-day talent acquisition and employee experience. He's been the primary InHerSight user but is overwhelmed with responsibilities and limited in decision-making authority.

## Communication Profile

**Preferred Channels:** Email
**Response Time:** 1-2 days (often delayed)
**Meeting Preference:** Short calls when possible

**Communication Style:**
- Stressed and stretched thin
- Wants tactical help, not strategy discussions
- Appreciates when we make things easy for him
- Apologetic about delays and cancellations

## Relationship History

**First Contact:** March 2024 (post-sale onboarding)
**Relationship Strength:** Moderate (friendly but limited influence)

**Key Moments:**
- Completed initial onboarding (with significant hand-holding)
- Attended one QBR (October - rescheduled twice)
- Has expressed frustration with lack of resources internally

## Role in Account

David is doing his best in a difficult situation. He doesn't have authority to make budget decisions, but he's our primary window into what's happening at TechCorp. He's also our best path to getting a meeting with the new CPO.

## Goals & Motivations

**Professional Reality:**
- Overwhelmed with responsibilities (HR team understaffed)
- Wants to prove value but lacks time to invest
- Needs quick wins to share with new CPO
- Worried about job security in leadership transition

**What He Needs from Us:**
- Low-effort, high-impact assistance
- Things he can quickly show to Jennifer Walsh
- Help making the case for continued investment

## Key Concerns

1. **Time constraints** - Can't dedicate hours to InHerSight optimization
2. **Internal pressure** - Needs to justify all vendor spend
3. **Uncertainty** - Doesn't know new CPO's priorities
4. **Career concerns** - Wants to be seen as valuable during transition

## Leverage Points

1. **Direct line to CPO** - Can facilitate introduction
2. **Ground-level insight** - Knows what's really happening
3. **Wants to succeed** - Will help if we make it easy

## Recent Interactions

**November 2024:**
- Mentioned budget pressure from CFO
- Agreed to try to arrange intro to Jennifer
- Asked for simple ROI summary he could forward

**October 2024:**
- QBR rescheduled twice, eventually happened
- Seemed stressed and distracted
- Tanya's departure came up as concern

## How to Work with David

**Do:**
- Keep asks simple and low-effort
- Provide ready-to-forward materials
- Acknowledge his constraints
- Offer to do the heavy lifting

**Don't:**
- Expect quick responses
- Ask for long meetings
- Put pressure on him
- Expect him to drive internal change

## CSM Notes

David is an ally but a limited one. He can't save the account himself, but he can help us get to Jennifer Walsh. We need to make his life easier, not harder. Provide him with polished, ready-to-share materials that make him look good to his new boss.

**Path to CPO through David:**
1. Send David a one-page value summary for TechCorp
2. Draft an intro email he can forward to Jennifer
3. Offer to do a "quick intro call" to make Jennifer's evaluation easy
4. Make David the hero who brought the solution
