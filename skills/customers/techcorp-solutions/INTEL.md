## Key Context
<!-- Persistent facts/concerns - remain until displaced by new information -->
- AT RISK: Health score 45/100, high churn risk (75)
- Primary contact: Jennifer Walsh (Chief People Officer) - new to role, relationship building
- Motivation is reactive: signed after Glassdoor backlash, not strategic buy-in
- Low engagement: profile completion at 45%, minimal active usage
- Board pressure driving DEI initiatives but limited internal championship

## Strategic Context

### Why They Use InHerSight
TechCorp faced backlash after a Glassdoor review went viral highlighting gender pay gaps. They signed with InHerSight as part of a reputation recovery effort. Motivation is more reactive than proactive.

### Business Context
1. Under pressure from board to improve diversity metrics
2. Struggling to recruit female engineers in competitive Denver market
3. Recently hired first Chief People Officer
4. Culture transformation initiative underway

### What Success Would Look Like
- Improved InHerSight rating (currently 3.2 stars)
- Positive press coverage to counter negative narratives
- Increased female candidate applications
- Evidence of culture improvement for board

## Value Delivered

### Metrics (Last Quarter)
- Brand Impressions: 15,000/month
- Profile Views: 850/month
- Profile Completion: 65%
- Job Matches: 45/month
- Apply Clicks: 12/month
- Article Inclusions: 2
- New Ratings: 8
- New Submissions: 5

### Challenges
- Profile is incomplete - missing key sections
- Response rate to reviews is low
- Limited engagement with platform features
- No clear owner - responsibility diffuse

## Risk Factors

### High Risk - Active Concerns
1. **Low engagement** - Platform login frequency declining
2. **Incomplete profile** - 65% completion hurts visibility
3. **Budget pressure** - CFO questioning all vendor spend
4. **Champion gap** - Original buyer left, no clear replacement

### Watchlist
- New CPO (started October) - unknown stance on InHerSight
- Competing vendor evaluation rumored
- Q4 budget review in progress

## Expansion Opportunities

### Limited Near-Term
Given current risk profile, focus should be on saving the account, not expansion.

### If Relationship Stabilizes
1. Profile optimization consulting
2. Review response training
3. Employer branding workshop

## Stakeholder Map

**Key Players:**
- Jennifer Walsh (CPO) - New, building relationship needed
- David Kim (HR Manager) - Day-to-day contact, overwhelmed
- CFO (unknown name) - Budget pressure source

## Communication Preferences

- Prefer email communication
- Monthly check-ins often rescheduled
- Response times have slowed recently
- Need to rebuild cadence with new CPO

## Recent Updates

### November 2024
- Reached out to new CPO Jennifer Walsh - no response yet
- David Kim mentioned budget review pressure
- Profile views declining month over month

### October 2024
- New CPO Jennifer Walsh started
- Previous champion (Tanya Roberts) left company
- Attempted QBR - rescheduled twice, eventually cancelled

### September 2024
- Saw uptick in negative reviews
- Recommended review response strategy - not implemented

## Upcoming

- **Urgent:** Get meeting with new CPO before year-end
- **Renewal Conversation:** Must start immediately (90-day runway)
- **Risk Mitigation:** Prepare value story for CFO budget review

## CSM Notes

TechCorp is in trouble. The original champion left, engagement has dropped, and there's active budget pressure. The new CPO is an unknown quantity - could be an opportunity to reset the relationship or could accelerate churn.

**Renewal Strategy:** Save (risk mitigation focus)
**Priority:** Critical
**CSM Owner:** Grace (demo user)

**Immediate Actions Needed:**
1. Secure meeting with new CPO Jennifer Walsh
2. Prepare ROI analysis for CFO budget review
3. Help David Kim optimize profile to show quick wins
4. Document value delivered to date for renewal conversation
