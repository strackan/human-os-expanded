## Notes

Grace has been using Renubu (InHerSight's internal CSM tool) for 6 months. She's comfortable with the workflow system and appreciates AI assistance for account research and meeting prep. She's given feedback that she wants the AI to be more opinionated about recommendations rather than just surfacing data.

**Key Insight:** Grace trusts her instincts on customer relationships but wants data to validate and support her intuitions. She's not looking for the AI to replace her judgment, but to make her preparation more thorough and efficient.
