## Per-Archetype Voice Snapshots

### Conan O'Brien
- **Energy:** High, manic, self-undermining
- **Vibe:** "I'm the most famous person in the room and somehow the most insecure"
- **Opening move:** Self-deprecating observation that escalates to absurdity
- **Signature moves:** Physical comedy translated to text (beat descriptions), escalating hypotheticals, genuine warmth hidden behind three layers of irony
- **Would NEVER:** Be earnestly motivational without undercutting it, use corporate speak, take himself seriously for more than 30 seconds

### Stephen Colbert
- **Energy:** Sharp, knowing, intellectually playful
- **Vibe:** "I know more than I'm letting on, and we both know it"
- **Opening move:** Deadpan observation with a wink
- **Signature moves:** Persona shifts (sincere vs character), intellectual references worn lightly, format-breaking meta-commentary
- **Would NEVER:** Be aggressively confrontational, use crude humor without purpose, abandon sincerity entirely

### Brene Brown
- **Energy:** Warm, grounded, research-backed vulnerability
- **Vibe:** "I've done the work and I'm going to tell you what I found, even the uncomfortable parts"
- **Opening move:** Personal story that illuminates a universal truth
- **Signature moves:** Vulnerability as teaching tool, naming hard emotions precisely, "the data says..." followed by personal confirmation
- **Would NEVER:** Use sarcasm as a weapon, dismiss emotions, be performatively tough, hide behind jargon

### Gary Vee
- **Energy:** Relentless, confrontational, urgent
- **Vibe:** "Stop making excuses and do the work, I believe in you but I'm not going to coddle you"
- **Opening move:** Bold declaration that challenges assumptions

- **Would NEVER:** Hedge, apologize for directness, engage in nuanced philosophical discussion, slow down

### Justin Strackany
- **Energy:** Intellectual contrarian with hidden warmth
- **Vibe:** "Let me tell you something weird I noticed, and also here's a 300-word tangent about Kafka"
- **Opening move:** Specific observation that becomes a rabbit hole
- **Signature moves:** Absurdist tangents (F7), spacing as pacing (F8), Andy Kaufman rug-pulls (F10), parenthetical asides, vocabulary whiplash
- **Would NEVER:** Write generic LinkedIn content, use em dashes, be motivational without subversion, apologize for being weird

### Ted Lasso
- **Energy:** Radically optimistic, disarmingly sincere
- **Vibe:** "I believe in you more than you believe in yourself, and I'm not embarrassed about that"
- **Opening move:** Folksy analogy that lands harder than expected

- **Would NEVER:** Be cynical, use intellectual intimidation, make someone feel stupid, give up on someone

### Bob Ross
- **Energy:** Calm, patient, encouraging
- **Vibe:** "There are no mistakes, only happy accidents, and I genuinely mean that"

## How Archetypes Are Used

Archetypes are **internal voice cues**, never user-facing labels.

1. **Calibrate voice generation tone** -- archetype proximity tells the system how to weight dimensions
2. **Constellation presentation** (if surfaced at all) -- "You've got Colbert's knowing wink, Brene's sincerity, and a touch of Justin's directness"
3. **Never hard-pin** -- always a blend of 2-3 reference points
4. **Use traits not names** when possible -- reduces risk of unfavorable comparison
