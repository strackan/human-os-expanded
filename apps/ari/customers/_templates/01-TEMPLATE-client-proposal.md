## The Opportunity

When consumers ask AI assistants "{{EXAMPLE_QUERY}}", **{{COMPANY_NAME}} is rarely mentioned.**

## Key Findings

### Current AI Visibility: {{VISIBILITY_PCT}}%

| Metric | {{COMPANY_NAME}} | Top Competitor ({{TOP_COMPETITOR}}) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **AI Mention Rate** | {{VISIBILITY_PCT}}% | {{COMPETITOR_PCT}}% |
| **Models Mentioning** | {{MODELS_MENTIONING}} of {{TOTAL_MODELS}} | {{COMPETITOR_MODELS}} of {{TOTAL_MODELS}} |
| **Avg Ranking** | #{{AVG_RANK}} (when mentioned) | #{{COMPETITOR_RANK}} |

**The gap:** {{TOP_COMPETITOR}} appears in AI recommendations **{{GAP_MULTIPLIER}}x more often** than {{COMPANY_NAME}}.

### Where {{COMPANY_SHORT}} Does Appear

{{POSITIVE_MENTIONS_LIST}}

**The story is strong. The distribution is weak.**

## Why This Is Happening

AI models learn from published content: news articles, educational guides, review sites, and authoritative sources. Our source analysis of {{TOTAL_CITATIONS}} citations reveals:

### Top Sources AI Models Cite
| Source Type | Citations |
|-------------|----------|
| News/Media Sites | {{NEWS_CITATIONS}} |
| Blogs/Content Sites | {{BLOG_CITATIONS}} |
| Educational Sites | {{EDU_CITATIONS}} |
| Review Sites | {{REVIEW_CITATIONS}} |
