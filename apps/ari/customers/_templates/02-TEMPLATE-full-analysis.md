## Executive Summary

{{COMPANY_NAME}} has **{{VISIBILITY_PCT}}% visibility** across AI-generated responses - {{VISIBILITY_ASSESSMENT}} compared to competitors {{COMPETITOR_LIST_INLINE}}. Across {{TOTAL_PROMPTS}} prompts sent to {{TOTAL_MODELS}} major AI models, {{COMPANY_SHORT}} was mentioned only **{{MENTION_COUNT}} times out of {{TOTAL_SLOTS}} possible slots** ({{VISIBILITY_PCT}}%). {{VISIBILITY_DETAIL}}.

However, the data reveals clear leverage points. When {{COMPANY_SHORT}} *is* mentioned, it's for differentiated strengths ({{DIFFERENTIATORS_SHORT}}) that competitors can't easily claim.

## Measurement Plan

### Baseline Metrics (Current)
- Overall AI visibility: {{VISIBILITY_PCT}}%
- Mentions per {{TOTAL_SLOTS}} slots: {{MENTION_COUNT}}
- Models mentioning {{COMPANY_SHORT}}: {{MODELS_MENTIONING}} of {{TOTAL_MODELS}}
- Best persona: {{BEST_PERSONA}} at {{BEST_PERSONA_PCT}}%
- Best topic: {{BEST_TOPIC}} at {{BEST_TOPIC_PCT}}%

### Success Metrics (30-60 Days Post-Publication)
- Target overall visibility: {{TARGET_VISIBILITY}}% ({{TARGET_MULTIPLIER}}x current)
- Target mentions: {{TARGET_MENTIONS}} per {{TOTAL_SLOTS}} slots
- Target models mentioning {{COMPANY_SHORT}}: {{TARGET_MODELS}}+ of {{TOTAL_MODELS}}
{{SPECIFIC_TARGETS}}

### Re-measurement Protocol
Run the same {{TOTAL_PROMPTS}}-prompt battery across all {{TOTAL_MODELS}} models at 30 and 60 days post-publication.
