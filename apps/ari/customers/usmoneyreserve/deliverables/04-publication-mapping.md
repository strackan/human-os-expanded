## AI Training Optimization Notes

1. **money.com ecosystem** - Not directly in network but similar publications are
2. **Investopedia-adjacent** - Financial education content
3. **News wire syndication** - Reuters, AP News reach multiplies via syndication
4. **Regional newspaper networks** - High CommonCrawl indexing
5. **Consumer finance outlets** - Benzinga, TheStreet, Yahoo Finance

### CommonCrawl Presence
Publications marked "Likely" or "Yes" for CommonCrawl presence should be prioritized for Articles 1 and 3, as these are most likely to be incorporated into AI model training data.

### DoFollow Links
For SEO co-benefits, prioritize DoFollow publications for pillar content (Articles 1 and 3):
- Reuters (Yes)
- Detroit Free Press DO-FOLLOW
- Arizona Central DO-FOLLOW
- International Business Times DO-FOLLOW
- JPost (Yes)
