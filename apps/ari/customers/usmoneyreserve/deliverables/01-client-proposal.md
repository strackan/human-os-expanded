## The Opportunity

When consumers ask AI assistants "What's the best gold dealer?" or "Where should I buy precious metals?", **U.S. Money Reserve is almost never mentioned.**

Our analysis tested 80 prompts across 9 major AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok, Google AI Overview). The results reveal a critical visibility gap - and a clear path to fix it.

## Key Findings

### Current AI Visibility: 3.6%

| Metric | U.S. Money Reserve | Top Competitor (APMEX) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **AI Mention Rate** | 3.6% | 66% |
| **Models Mentioning** | 3 of 9 | 9 of 9 |
| **Avg Ranking** | #5.2 (when mentioned) | #2.1 |

**The gap:** APMEX appears in AI recommendations **18x more often** than U.S. Money Reserve.

### Competitor Landscape

| Dealer | AI Visibility |
|--------|--------------|
| APMEX | 66% |
| JM Bullion | 63% |
| SD Bullion | 44% |
| Goldco | 32% |
| **U.S. Money Reserve** | **3.6%** |

### Where USMR Does Appear

When AI models *do* mention U.S. Money Reserve, they highlight strengths competitors can't claim:

- **"Specializes in U.S. government-issued gold and silver"**
- **"Features guidance from former U.S. Mint directors"**
- **"Guarantees to buy back, ensuring fast, no-hassle liquidation"**
- **"PCGS-certified gold coins, often graded 69 or 70"**

**The story is strong. The distribution is weak.**
