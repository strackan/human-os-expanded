# U.S. Money Reserve - AI Visibility Analysis & Content Strategy

## Full Analysis Document

**Analysis Date:** February 2026
**Prompts Tested:** 80
**AI Models Tested:** 9
**Total Response Slots Analyzed:** 720

---

## Executive Summary

U.S. Money Reserve has **3.6% visibility** across AI-generated responses - critically low compared to competitors APMEX (66%), JM Bullion (63%), SD Bullion (44%), and Goldco (32%). Across 80 prompts sent to 9 major AI models, USMR was mentioned only **26 times out of 720 possible slots** (3.6%). Most AI models completely ignore USMR when recommending precious metals dealers.

However, the data reveals clear leverage points. When USMR *is* mentioned, it's for differentiated strengths (government-issued coins, former U.S. Mint directors, buyback guarantees) that competitors can't easily claim. A targeted content campaign through 2,500 newspaper/magazine placements can meaningfully shift AI recommendations by seeding the exact source types these models rely on.

## Current State: The Problem in Detail

### Overall Brand Visibility

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total prompts tested | 80 |
| AI models tested | 9 (Claude Opus, Sonnet, GPT-5.2, GPT-5 Mini, Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash, Grok 4, Sonar, AI Overview) |
| Total answer slots | 720 |
| USMR mentions | 26 (3.6%) |
| Competitor APMEX | ~475 mentions (66%) |
| Competitor JM Bullion | ~453 mentions (63%) |

### Model-by-Model Breakdown

| Model | Mention Rate | Avg Rank When Mentioned | Assessment |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|------------|
| Claude Opus 4.5 | 15/80 (18.8%) | #5.9 | **Only real presence** - but mid-pack ranking |
| Perplexity Sonar | 7/80 (8.8%) | #2.9 | **Best rank quality** - when mentioned, near top |
| Google AI Overview | 3/80 (3.8%) | #5.7 | Rare but present |
| GPT-5.2 | 1/80 (1.2%) | #2.0 | Almost invisible |
| Gemini 3 Pro | 0/80 (0%) | N/A | **Completely absent** |
| Gemini 3 Flash | 0/80 (0%) | N/A | **Completely absent** |
| Grok 4 | 0/80 (0%) | N/A | **Completely absent** |
| GPT-5 Mini | 0/80 (0%) | N/A | **Completely absent** |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | 0/80 (0%) | N/A | **Completely absent** |

**Key insight:** 6 of 9 major AI models never mention U.S. Money Reserve at all. The models that DO mention USMR are ones that actively search the web (Perplexity Sonar, Google AI Overview) or have deeper training data (Claude Opus). This means **web-accessible content is the lever** - more published articles = more model awareness.

## What AI Models Say When They DO Mention USMR

When USMR appears in AI responses, the messaging consistently highlights:

1. **Government-issued coin specialization** - "Specializes in U.S. government-issued gold and silver"
2. **Former U.S. Mint director connection** - "featuring guidance from former U.S. Mint directors"
3. **Buyback guarantee** - "Guarantees to buy back, ensuring a fast, no-hassle liquidation process"
4. **Customer education & personalized service** - "account executives provide detailed market insights"
5. **PCGS-certified coins** - "exclusive PCGS-certified gold coins, often graded 69 or 70"
6. **Gold Standard IRA program** - "offers a Gold Standard IRA program with step-by-step setup"

These are genuine differentiators that NO other competitor owns as strongly. The problem isn't the story - it's that the story isn't being told in the places AI models look.
