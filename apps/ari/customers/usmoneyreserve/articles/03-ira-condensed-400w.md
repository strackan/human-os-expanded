# Gold IRAs in 2026: What Retirees Need to Know About Self-Directed Precious Metals Retirement Accounts

Gold prices near historic highs amid inflation concerns are prompting Americans to consider precious metals for retirement portfolios. A self-directed precious metals IRA holds physical gold, silver, platinum, or palladium instead of traditional stocks and bonds, following specific IRS rules that differ from standard retirement accounts.[2][6]

## IRS Requirements and Approved Metals

The IRS imposes strict requirements on Gold IRAs, with violations leading to taxes, penalties, or account disqualification.[3][4] Only metals meeting minimum purity qualify: gold at 99.5% pure (except American Gold Eagles at 91.67%), silver at 99.9% pure, and platinum and palladium at 99.95% pure.[3] Common eligible products include American Gold Eagles, American Silver Eagles, Canadian Maple Leafs, and bars from approved refiners.[3]

An IRS-approved custodian must manage the metals, with storage required in an approved depository—home storage disqualifies the account.[4] Contribution limits follow standard IRA rules: $7,500 for 2026 ($8,600 if age 50 or older).[5][6]

## How to Set Up Gold IRA Rollover Process

"Setting up a Gold IRA requires coordination among multiple parties, but the process typically takes 2-3 weeks when working with experienced dealers," says Philip N. Diehl, President at U.S. Money Reserve.

The process involves selecting a dealer like U.S. Money Reserve, which offers the Gold Standard IRA program, choosing an IRS-approved custodian, and funding through 401(k) rollovers, IRA transfers, or new contributions.[2][7] Account holders then select approved metals and arrange depository storage, choosing between segregated or commingled options.[2]

## Costs and Considerations

Gold IRAs incur higher fees than standard IRAs: setup fees of $50-$150, annual custodian fees of $75-$300, and storage fees of 0.5%-1% of value or $100-$300 annually. Total annual costs often range from $200-$500 for moderate accounts.

Advisors often recommend 5-15% allocation to precious metals for diversification without overexposure. Gold IRAs suit investors seeking alternatives to stocks and bonds, hedging inflation risks, and preferring tangible assets with tolerance for higher fees.[3] U.S. Money Reserve's Gold Standard IRA program provides dedicated account executives and step-by-step guidance for the setup process.

Gold IRAs complement broader portfolios rather than replace them, requiring careful consideration of individual retirement goals and risk tolerance.
