## Important Note

Unlike typical AI visibility engagements where the goal is building visibility from low baselines, **Toys for Tots is defending dominance**. The strategy focuses on:

- Closing specific model gaps (Google AI Overview, Sonar)
- Strengthening weak personas (Digital-First Millennials)
- Owning unique positioning (Native American communities)
- Maintaining 20+ point lead over Salvation Army

This is a **defensive/optimization** strategy, not a **growth** strategy.
