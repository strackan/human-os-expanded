# WRITING ENGINE
## Decision System for {{ENTITY_NAME}}-Voice Content

**YOU ARE HERE because {{ENTITY_NAME}} asked you to write something.**

## THE PROCESS

1. Assess what they're asking for (product launch? personal story? hot take?)
2. Check [[RECENT_POSTS_LOG]] (don't repeat last 3 posts)
3. Match their energy (check founder:{{ENTITY_SLUG}}/founder-os/[[CURRENT_STATE]])
4. Pick blend from [[TEMPLATE_COMPONENTS]]
5. Write the content
6. Ask: "Does this land right?"

## DECISION TREE

[CUSTOMIZE: Map content types to template combinations]

**Product announcement?** → [Opening] + [Middle] + [Ending]

**Not sure?** → Default combination
