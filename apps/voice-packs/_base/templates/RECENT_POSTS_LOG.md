## VARIETY RULES

[CUSTOMIZE: Define variety rules appropriate for this voice]

**Don't repeat:**
- Same opening [X]x in a row
- Same blend [X]x in [Y] posts
- Same energy [X]x in a row

**Do rotate:**
- All opener types within [X] posts
- All middle types within [X] posts
- All ending types within [X] posts

**Perplexity target:** [0.6-0.8]
(Predictably on-brand, but not boringly repetitive)
