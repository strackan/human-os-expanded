# Demo Roadmap - Features for Demo Deck Only

**Purpose:** This folder contains specifications for features that are **NOT in the active development roadmap** but may be built if customers request them.

**Status:** Demo-only (slides, not product)
**Decision Date:** November 6, 2025
**Decision Maker:** Justin Strackany + Queen Bee PM

---

## What Is The Demo Roadmap?

Features in this folder are:
- ✅ **Designed** and **spec'd** for sales conversations
- ✅ **Demo-able** with slides and mockups
- ❌ **NOT being built** proactively
- ❌ **NOT in any active sprint or phase**

**Build Trigger:** 2+ design partners explicitly request the feature

---

## Current Demo Roadmap Features

### 1. Weekly Planner
**Status:** Moved to demo roadmap Nov 6, 2025
**Original Effort:** 109h
**Revised Effort:** 40-60h (with workflow snoozing infrastructure)
**Build Trigger:** 2+ design partners request it

**Why Deferred:**
- Zero customer demand to date
- Not core to "learning loop" value proposition
- Can be demoed effectively with slides
- Moves away from core promise ("I won't let you forget")
- Feature creep risk

**If Customers Request:**
- Becomes Q2 2026 active project
- Benefits from workflow snoozing foundation
- Faster to build with existing infrastructure

**Documentation:**
- See archived specs in `docs/archive/2025-11-pre-reorg/labs/`
  - WEEKLY-PLANNER-OVERVIEW.md
  - WEEKLY-PLANNER-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md

## How To Use Demo Roadmap

### For Sales/Demos
1. Show slides/mockups of the feature
2. Gauge customer interest
3. If 2+ customers say "we need this", escalate to roadmap discussion

### For Product Development
1. DO NOT proactively build these features
2. Keep specs updated if architecture changes
3. If build trigger met, move to active roadmap with proper planning

### For Roadmap Planning
1. Review quarterly: Are any features getting requested?
2. If yes: Consider adding to roadmap
3. If no: Keep in demo roadmap

## Decision Criteria

**Move FROM Active → Demo Roadmap When:**
- Zero customer demand
- Not core to value proposition
- Can be demoed without building
- Feature creep risk
- Limited resources (better priorities exist)

**Move FROM Demo → Active Roadmap When:**
- 2+ design partners explicitly request it
- Aligns with core value prop
- Resources available (not displacing higher priorities)
- Strategic timing makes sense

## History

**November 6, 2025:**
- Created Demo Roadmap concept
- Moved Weekly Planner from Q1 2026 active roadmap
- Reason: Elevating Human OS Check-Ins (learning loop) as competitive moat
- Weekly Planner had zero customer requests, was feature creep

**Remember:** Demo Roadmap ≠ "Never Build"
Demo Roadmap = "Build When Customers Ask"
