# Features - Product Roadmap Registry

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-07 (Auto-generated from features table)
**Version:** 0.1
**Audience:** Internal (Product, Engineering, Sales)

---

## Overview

This document is **auto-generated from the `features` database table**. It provides a comprehensive view of all features across their lifecycle: active development, planned, backlog, deferred, and shipped.

**Do not edit this file manually.** Update the `features` table instead.

---

## Feature Status Definitions

- **active** - Currently in development
- **planned** - Approved and scheduled for a specific phase
- **backlog** - Not yet prioritized or scheduled
- **deferred** - Explicitly postponed with conditions to revisit
- **shipped** - In production and available to users

---

## Active Features (In Development)

### Workflow Snoozing
**Status:** Active (Phase 1)
**Priority:** 1 (Highest)
**Effort:** 125 hours
**Timeline:** Nov 25 - Dec 20, 2025

**Business Case:**
Core product promise: "I won't let you forget." Enables users to park workflows until specific dates or business conditions are met.

**Technical Approach:**
- Condition-based wake logic
- Database fields: `snoozed_until`, `wake_conditions`
- Daily cron evaluation service
- Smart surface algorithm

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can snooze workflows with date + condition
- 90%+ accuracy in wake condition detection
- Handles 1000+ snoozed workflows efficiently
- 80%+ user adoption

**Phase:** 1
**Category:** workflow
**Dependencies:** None

---

## Planned Features (Approved & Scheduled)

### Parking Lot
**Status:** Planned (Phase 2)
**Priority:** 2
**Effort:** 16 hours
**Timeline:** Jan 6-17, 2026

**Business Case:**
Quick capture for non-time-sensitive ideas and tasks. Provides peace of mind that nothing is forgotten without cluttering active workflows.

**Technical Approach:**
- Simple table: `parking_lot_items`
- Tag-based organization
- Quick add UI
- No dates or conditions (unlike snoozing)

**Success Criteria:**
- Can capture idea in <5 seconds
- Tag-based filtering works
- Design partners actively using

**Phase:** 2
**Category:** workflow
**Dependencies:** None

---

### Human OS Check-Ins
**Status:** Planned (Phase 3)
**Priority:** 1 (Highest)
**Effort:** 32 hours (reduced from 64h via Human OS platform integration)
**Timeline:** Feb 3 - Mar 28, 2026

**Business Case:**
THE competitive moat. Creates learning loop where system discovers what works for each specific user. Justifies premium pricing ($200/user vs $50/user).

**Technical Approach (Updated Dec 2025):**
Leverages Human OS platform as external service instead of building from scratch. Uses Context API for check-in storage, Graph API for pattern detection, and Entity API for relationship tracking.

See [HUMAN_OS_INTEGRATION.md](./HUMAN_OS_INTEGRATION.md) for full API reference and integration patterns.

**Success Criteria:**
- 80%+ check-in completion rate
- Patterns detected after 5+ workflows
- Recommendations shown with 70%+ confidence
- 2+ design partners find it useful
- Human OS API response time <500ms

**Phase:** 3
**Category:** ai
**Dependencies:** Workflow Snoozing (for completion tracking), Human OS Integration (Phase 0.2)

---

### Human OS Integration
**Status:** Planned (Phase 0.2)
**Priority:** 1 (Highest)
**Effort:** 16 hours
**Timeline:** Phase 0.2 (Jan 2026)

**Business Case:**
Foundation for Human OS Check-Ins (Phase 3). Enables Renubu to store context, relationships, and patterns in the Human OS knowledge graph. Reduces Check-Ins implementation from 64h to 32h.

**Technical Approach:**
- API key provisioning for Renubu tenants
- Context file storage for workflow completions (`renubu:tenant-{id}` layer)
- Entity creation for people/companies mentioned in workflows
- Graph queries for pattern detection and recommendations
- Wiki link parsing for automatic relationship indexing

**Success Criteria:**
- Renubu can create context files in `renubu:tenant-{id}` layer
- Entities auto-created from workflow data
- Graph queries return relationship data
- API key scoping works correctly per tenant
- <500ms response time for common queries

**Phase:** 0.2
**Category:** infrastructure
**Dependencies:** Human OS platform (ready), MCP registry infrastructure

---

### Google Calendar Integration
**Status:** Planned (Phase 0.2)
**Priority:** 2
**Effort:** 8 hours

- Search emails

**Success Criteria:**
- Can send emails (with user confirmation)
- Integration secure and admin-approved

**Phase:** 0.2
**Category:** integration
**Dependencies:** MCP registry infrastructure

---

## Backlog Features (Not Yet Prioritized)

### Custom MCP Servers
**Status:** Backlog
**Priority:** 4 (Low)
**Effort:** 40 hours (estimate)
**Timeline:** TBD (Post-Q1 2026)

**Business Case:**
Allow power users to add custom MCP servers for niche integrations. Currently deferred due to security concerns.

**Technical Approach:**
- User provides MCP server URL
- Heavy security warnings
- Admin approval required
- Restricted permissions
- Verbose audit logging

**Deferred Reason:**
High security risk. Renubu is hub platform with privileged access. Malicious MCP servers could exfiltrate data. Need robust security framework first.

**Deferred Conditions:**
- Post-Q1 2026 (after core product ships)
- Security framework validated
- Customer demand proven (3+ requests)

**Phase:** TBD
**Category:** infrastructure
**Dependencies:** MCP marketplace, audit logging

---

### HubSpot Integration
**Status:** Backlog
**Priority:** 3
**Effort:** 12 hours (estimate)
**Timeline:** TBD (MCP marketplace expansion)

**Business Case:**
Popular CRM alternative to Salesforce. Some customers use HubSpot.

**Phase:** TBD
**Category:** integration
**Dependencies:** MCP marketplace infrastructure

---

### Salesforce Integration
**Status:** Backlog
**Priority:** 3
**Effort:** 16 hours (estimate)
**Timeline:** TBD (MCP marketplace expansion)

**Business Case:**
Enterprise CRM standard. Update opportunities, log activities, sync data.

**Phase:** TBD
**Category:** integration
**Dependencies:** MCP marketplace infrastructure

---

### Notion Integration
**Status:** Backlog
**Priority:** 3
**Effort:** 8 hours (estimate)
**Timeline:** TBD

**Business Case:**
Popular knowledge management tool. Sync workflows to Notion databases.

**Phase:** TBD
**Category:** integration
**Dependencies:** MCP marketplace infrastructure

---

### Airtable Integration
**Status:** Backlog
**Priority:** 3
**Effort:** 8 hours (estimate)
**Timeline:** TBD

**Business Case:**
Flexible database tool used by many teams.

**Phase:** TBD
**Category:** integration
**Dependencies:** MCP marketplace infrastructure

---

## Deferred Features (Postponed with Conditions)

### Weekly Planner
**Status:** Deferred (Demo Roadmap)
**Priority:** N/A (Build only if customers request)
**Effort:** 40-60 hours (with snooze infrastructure)
**Original Effort:** 109 hours

**Business Case:**
AI-powered weekly planning that integrates work commitments with calendar. Nice-to-have but not core differentiator.

**Deferred Reason:**
- Zero customer demand to date
- Not core to "learning loop" value proposition
- Gainsight already has this (not our moat)
- Can be demoed effectively without building
- Resource allocation better spent on Human OS Check-Ins

**Deferred Conditions:**
- **Build Trigger:** 2+ design partners explicitly request it
- **Timeline if triggered:** Q2 2026
- **Fast-track approach:** Now 40-60h (vs 109h) due to workflow snoozing infrastructure

**What's Already Built (helps if we build later):**
- Workflow snoozing (Phase 1)
- Task management
- Calendar integration stubs
- Workload analysis service
- Database schema (7 tables deployed but inactive)

**Documentation:**
- Detailed spec: `docs/demo-roadmap/weekly-planner-overview.md`
- Development plan: `docs/demo-roadmap/weekly-planner-development-plan.md`
- Status tracking: `docs/demo-roadmap/weekly-planner-status.md`

**Phase:** Demo Roadmap (not in active roadmap)
**Category:** workflow
**Dependencies:** None (could be standalone)

## Feature Request Process

### How to Request a Feature

**Internal (Product/Engineering):**
1. Add to `features` table with status "backlog"
2. Include business case and technical approach
3. Propose priority and effort estimate
4. Review in weekly product meeting

**External (Customer):**
1. Customer Success logs feature request
2. Add to `features` table with `requested_by_customers` array
3. If 2+ customers request → Move to "planned"
4. CSM notifies customers of status

### Approval Process

**Backlog → Planned:**
- Product lead approval required
- Must have clear business case
- Must fit in phase timeline
- Dependencies must be resolved

**Planned → Active:**
- Engineering lead review
- Technical design approved
- Resources allocated
- Phase kickoff

**Deferred → Planned:**
- Deferred conditions met (e.g., "2+ customers requested")
- Business case re-validated
- Priority re-assessed
