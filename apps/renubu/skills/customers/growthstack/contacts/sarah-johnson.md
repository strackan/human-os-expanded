| Objection | Response That Worked |
|-----------|---------------------|

| "Price is high vs. Glassdoor" | Demonstrated quality of candidate match data |
| "Board wants consolidated vendors" | Positioned as specialized DEI tool vs. generalist |

- Active on LinkedIn - engages with InHerSight content

## Recent Interactions

**November 2024:**
- Discussed Enterprise tier upgrade, showed genuine interest
- Mentioned API integration desire for Greenhouse
- Requested data for upcoming board presentation

**October 2024:**
- QBR call - very positive, exceeded all success metrics
- Introduced us to new VP of HR (Jamie Williams)
- Shared 2025 goals and expansion plans

## Upcoming

- January QBR scheduled
- Renewal conversation to start December
- London office expansion discussion needed

## CSM Notes

Sarah is our model champion. She genuinely believes in the InHerSight mission and has the influence to drive decisions. The renewal should be straightforward - focus on Enterprise upgrade and multi-year. She's already primed for expansion.

Main risk is ensuring the new VP of HR (Jamie) is brought into the fold. Sarah can help with that introduction but we need to build our own relationship with Jamie.
