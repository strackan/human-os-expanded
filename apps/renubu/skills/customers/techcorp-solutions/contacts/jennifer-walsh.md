# Jennifer Walsh - Contact Intelligence

## Role & Influence

**Title:** Chief People Officer
**Department:** Human Resources
**Reports To:** CEO
**Tenure:** Started October 2024 (2 months)

Jennifer was hired to lead TechCorp's culture transformation after a series of challenges including a viral Glassdoor review and the departure of several HR leaders. She has full authority over HR tech stack but is still learning the vendor landscape she inherited.

## Communication Profile

**Preferred Channels:** Unknown - still building relationship
**Response Time:** Unknown
**Meeting Preference:** Unknown

**What We Know:**
- Came from larger enterprise (Fortune 500 background)
- Strong change management experience
- Likely has opinions on vendor consolidation
- Inherited InHerSight without context on its value

## Relationship History

**First Contact:** November 2024 (outreach sent, no response)
**Relationship Strength:** Weak (no relationship established)

**Outreach Attempts:**
- November 12: Email introduction - no response
- November 19: Follow-up email - no response
- November 25: LinkedIn connection request - pending

## Goals & Motivations (Inferred)

**Likely Priorities:**
- Assessing inherited vendor relationships
- Quick wins to build credibility with CEO/board
- Addressing culture issues that prompted her hire
- Building her team (likely hiring key roles)

**Potential Skepticisms:**
- May question vendors signed before she arrived
- Wants to see clear ROI for all investments
- May prefer vendors she's used at previous companies

## Engagement Strategy

**Priority:** Secure meeting before year-end

**Approach:**
1. Acknowledge she inherited InHerSight
2. Offer low-pressure "state of the relationship" conversation
3. Come prepared with value delivered summary
4. Ask about her priorities (don't assume)
5. Position InHerSight as tool for her transformation goals

**Key Messages:**
- "We know you inherited this relationship"
- "Here's what we've delivered so far"
- "We'd love to understand your priorities"
- "How can we help with your transformation initiatives?"

## Risk Factors

- No response to outreach attempts
- Unknown stance on InHerSight
- May be doing vendor consolidation
- Budget pressure from CFO

## What We Need to Learn

1. What are her priorities for first 6 months?
2. How is she evaluating inherited vendor relationships?
3. What does she need to show the board?
4. Is she open to continuing InHerSight partnership?

## CSM Notes

Jennifer is a wildcard. She could be a reset opportunity if we can connect and show value, or she could be the decision-maker who chooses not to renew. We must get a meeting before year-end to have any chance at the February renewal.

David Kim (HR Manager) might be our path in - he works with her daily and could make an introduction if positioned correctly.
