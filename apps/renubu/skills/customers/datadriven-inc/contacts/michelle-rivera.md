# Michelle Rivera - Contact Intelligence

## Role & Influence

**Title:** Director of Talent
**Department:** Human Resources
**Reports To:** COO (no dedicated HR exec)
**Tenure:** 2 years at DataDriven

Michelle is the most senior HR/Talent leader at DataDriven. She has influence but not final budget authority - the CFO Tom Anderson controls spend. She believes in InHerSight but struggles to prove ROI internally.

## Communication Profile

**Preferred Channels:** Email
**Response Time:** 1-2 days
**Meeting Preference:** Bi-weekly calls (often rescheduled)

**Communication Style:**
- Analytical - works in data company, thinks in data
- Stressed - under pressure to prove vendor value
- Apologetic - often behind on commitments
- Genuine - truly wants partnership to work

## Relationship History

**First Contact:** March 2024 (onboarding)
**Relationship Strength:** Moderate (friendly but challenged)

**Key Moments:**
- Good initial onboarding and adoption
- Q2 QBR was positive
- Q3 engagement declined due to internal pressure
- Q4 flagged budget concerns

## Goals & Motivations

**Professional Reality:**
- Under pressure from CFO to justify all vendor spend
- Needs clear attribution and ROI data
- Competing for budget with other departments
- Trying to build data science talent pipeline

**What She Needs:**
- Compelling ROI story for CFO
- Easy-to-present metrics
- Success stories from similar companies
- Help with profile optimization

**Success Metrics She Tracks:**
- Data science candidate pipeline
- InHerSight sourced applicants
- Cost per hire from InHerSight
- Interview conversion rates

## Key Concerns

1. **CFO skepticism** - Tom Anderson questions all HR tech spend
2. **Attribution gaps** - Lever ATS doesn't track InHerSight cleanly
3. **Time constraints** - Under-resourced for employer branding
4. **Competition** - Hired is reaching out to sales team

## Risk Signals

- Meetings being rescheduled more often
- Response times have slowed
- Mentions budget pressure frequently
- Profile optimization recommendations not actioned

## How to Help Michelle

**Priority 1: Arm her for CFO battle**
- Create ROI analysis with conservative estimates
- Provide industry benchmarks
- Draft executive summary she can present
- Offer to join meeting with CFO if helpful

**Priority 2: Make quick wins easy**
- Offer hands-on profile optimization session
- Provide review response templates
- Suggest low-effort improvements with high impact

**Priority 3: Address negative reviews**
- Help craft thoughtful responses
- Suggest internal actions based on feedback

## Recent Interactions

**November 2024:**
- Flagged budget pressure from Tom (CFO)
- Asked for ROI summary - we provided, awaiting feedback
- Mentioned competing vendor (Hired) reaching out

**October 2024:**
- QBR completed - metrics flat
- Agreed profile needs optimization - not yet done
- Stressed about January budget review

## CSM Notes

Michelle is a champion under pressure. She wants InHerSight to work and believes it can, but she's struggling to make the internal case. We need to actively help her succeed - if she loses the budget battle, we lose the account.

**Immediate Priority:**
Before January budget review, we must arm Michelle with an ironclad ROI story. Consider offering hands-on support to optimize profile and generate quick wins before renewal conversation.

The CFO Tom is the real decision-maker. If we can get Michelle to arrange an intro, we should take it - but approach carefully as he's skeptical of vendors.
