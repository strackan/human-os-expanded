**Industry:** Business Intelligence / Analytics
**Size:** Mid-market (~280 employees)
**Founded:** 2016

DataDriven Inc provides analytics and BI solutions for mid-market companies. Technical, data-driven culture. They signed with InHerSight after struggling to recruit diverse data science talent in Chicago's competitive market.

## Relationship Status

**Risk Level:** At Risk (65)
**Opportunity Score:** 45 - Moderate potential if stabilized

**Current Contract:**

- Tier: Standard

**Relationship Tenure:** 9 months
**NPS Score:** 7 (Passive)

## Strategic Context

### Why They Use InHerSight
DataDriven needs to recruit diverse data science and analytics talent. Chicago market is competitive, and traditional tech recruiting sources haven't delivered diverse candidate pools.

### Business Challenges
1. Data science talent market is extremely competitive
2. Perception as "analytics company" vs "cool tech startup"
3. Leadership team lacks gender diversity (working to improve)
4. Remote work policies uncertain post-pandemic

### What Success Would Look Like
- Improved InHerSight rating (currently 3.5 stars)
- 25% increase in female applicants for technical roles
- Recognition for data science workplace
- Clear ROI attribution for recruiting spend

## Value Delivered

### Metrics (Last Quarter)
- Brand Impressions: 22,000/month
- Profile Views: 1,200/month
- Profile Completion: 70%
- Job Matches: 65/month
- Apply Clicks: 18/month
- Article Inclusions: 3
- New Ratings: 12
- New Submissions: 9

### Challenges
- Profile not fully optimized
- Limited content/story on page
- Response rate to reviews needs improvement
- Attribution tracking not set up in ATS

## Risk Factors

### Medium-High Risk
1. **ROI uncertainty** - Champion struggling to prove value to finance
2. **Profile gaps** - 70% completion limiting visibility
3. **Review sentiment** - Some recent negative reviews about work-life balance
4. **Limited engagement** - Monthly logins declined 30%

### Watchlist
- Budget review scheduled for January
- Competitor (Hired) is making inroads with sales team
- Champion (Michelle) seems stressed about proving value

## Expansion Opportunities

### Conditional on Risk Mitigation
1. **Profile Optimization Package** - Could improve metrics quickly
2. **Analytics Deep-Dive** - Connect their love of data to our metrics

### If Relationship Stabilizes
- Content marketing support
- Review response training

## Stakeholder Map

**Key Players:**
- Michelle Rivera (Director of Talent) - Primary contact, champion at risk
- Tom Anderson (CFO) - Budget holder, skeptical
- Priya Sharma (CEO) - Generally supportive but hands-off

## Communication Preferences

- Data-driven conversations essential
- Bi-weekly check-ins (often rescheduled)
- Email preferred over calls
- Need ROI reports for internal meetings

## Recent Updates

### November 2024
- Michelle flagged budget pressure from Tom (CFO)
- Helped prepare ROI summary for internal presentation
- Some negative reviews about "crunch time" culture appeared

### October 2024
- QBR completed - metrics flat vs prior period
- Discussed profile optimization - not yet actioned
- Michelle mentioned needing better attribution data

### September 2024
- Feature request for Lever integration (their ATS)
- Competitor Hired reaching out to their sales team

## Upcoming

- **Risk Mitigation:** January budget review is critical
- **Renewal Conversation:** Should start December/January
- **Profile Optimization:** Needs to happen before renewal

## CSM Notes

DataDriven is at a crossroads. Michelle believes in InHerSight but is struggling to prove value internally. The CFO Tom is skeptical of all HR tech spend. We need to arm Michelle with compelling ROI data before the January budget review.

The profile optimization issue is frustrating - we've recommended it multiple times but they haven't actioned. Need to make it easier or offer more hands-on support.

**Renewal Strategy:** Stabilize (risk mitigation + value demonstration)
**Priority:** High
**CSM Owner:** Grace (demo user)

**Immediate Actions Needed:**
1. Create detailed ROI analysis before January budget review
2. Offer profile optimization session (hands-on support)
3. Help address negative reviews with response templates
4. Build relationship with CFO Tom directly if possible
