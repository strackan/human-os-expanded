# CloudFirst Systems - Customer Intelligence

## Key Context
<!-- Persistent facts/concerns - remain until displaced by new information -->
- CRITICAL RISK: Health 40/100, churn risk 80 - renewal in 60 days
- CEO resigned September - interim leadership, all vendor contracts under review
- Champion departed: Previous sponsor (VP People) left with CEO
- Original sign-up was reactive (harassment lawsuit settlement)
- Culture transformation initiative stalled - recruiting paused
- No clear executive sponsor currently

## Recent Events
<!-- Time-based: last 60 days of activity -->
- **Nov 22, 2024**: Left voicemail for interim CFO re: renewal - no callback
- **Nov 10, 2024**: Board meeting reviewing vendor contracts (per inside source)
- **Oct 25, 2024**: Attempted outreach to new interim leadership - no response
- **Sep 28, 2024**: CEO resignation announced; VP People also departed

## Identity

**Company:** CloudFirst Systems
**Industry:** Cloud Infrastructure / DevOps
**Size:** Mid-market (~320 employees)
**Founded:** 2014
**Headquarters:** Seattle, WA

CloudFirst provides cloud migration and DevOps consulting services. Traditionally male-dominated "bro culture" that they've acknowledged needs to change. Recent executive shake-up has created uncertainty about all vendor relationships.

## Relationship Status

**Health Score:** 40/100 - Critical
**Risk Level:** Critical (80)
**Opportunity Score:** 25 - Survival focus

**Current Contract:**
- ARR: $95,000
- Contract Start: Jan 2024
- Renewal Date: Jan 25, 2025 (60 days)
- Tier: Standard

**Relationship Tenure:** 11 months
**NPS Score:** 5 (Detractor)

## Strategic Context

### Why They Originally Signed
CloudFirst faced a harassment lawsuit that resulted in significant settlement and PR damage. They signed with InHerSight as part of a broader culture transformation effort mandated by the board.

### Current Business Reality
1. CEO resigned in September - interim leadership
2. Board is reviewing all vendor contracts
3. Culture transformation initiative stalled
4. Recruiting is paused pending leadership stability

### Challenges
- No clear executive sponsor since CEO departure
- HR function is in flux (CHRO left in August)
- Budget is frozen for all non-essential spend
- Company morale is low across the board

## Value Delivered

### Metrics (Last Quarter)
- Brand Impressions: 8,000/month
- Profile Views: 450/month
- Profile Completion: 45%
- Job Matches: 20/month
- Apply Clicks: 5/month
- Article Inclusions: 1
- New Ratings: 3
- New Submissions: 2

### Issues
- Profile is severely neglected (45% completion)
- No logins in past 30 days
- Review responses stopped 3 months ago
- No champion or day-to-day user

## Risk Factors

### Critical Risk - Immediate Action Needed
1. **No champion** - Previous contacts have left
2. **Budget freeze** - All vendor renewals under scrutiny
3. **Leadership vacuum** - Interim CEO focused on stabilization
4. **Zero engagement** - No product usage in 30+ days
5. **60-day runway** - Renewal in 60 days with no relationship

### Reality Check
This account is likely to churn. Focus should be on:
- Documenting value delivered for any final conversation
- Attempting one last executive outreach
- Preparing for graceful wind-down if needed

## Stakeholder Map

**Current Status:**
- Previous champion (CHRO Karen Walsh) - Left August 2024
- Previous CEO (James Porter) - Resigned September 2024
- Interim CEO (Board member) - No relationship
- HR Manager (unknown) - Need to identify

## Communication Preferences

- All previous communication channels have gone cold
- Need to identify new contacts and rebuild from scratch

## Recent Updates

### November 2024
- Multiple outreach attempts - no response
- LinkedIn research shows significant turnover
- Board member posting about "stabilization phase"

### October 2024
- Email to Karen Walsh bounced (left company)
- General support email to HR - no response
- Identified need to find new contacts

### September 2024
- CEO resignation announced
- Account went dark
- Last login was September 3rd

## Upcoming

- **Renewal Date:** January 25, 2025 (60 days)
- **Critical Window:** Next 30 days determine save/churn

## CSM Notes

CloudFirst is in crisis mode as a company, and our relationship has collapsed with the departure of both the CEO and CHRO. This is a likely churn scenario.

**Realistic Assessment:**
- 80% probability of churn
- Budget freeze makes renewal very difficult
- No champion or relationship to leverage

**Hail Mary Options:**
1. LinkedIn outreach to board member overseeing operations
2. Find and connect with whoever is handling HR now
3. Offer significant concession (discount, reduced scope) if it helps save

**Renewal Strategy:** Save/Triage (likely churn)
**Priority:** Critical (timeline)
**CSM Owner:** Grace (demo user)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Identify who is currently responsible for HR
2. Prepare "value delivered" summary for any conversation
3. Consider executive escalation (have our leadership reach out)
4. Document lessons learned for future similar situations
