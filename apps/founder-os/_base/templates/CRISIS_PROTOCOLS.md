# CRISIS PROTOCOLS
## When {{ENTITY_NAME}} Is Overwhelmed

**YOU ARE HERE because {{ENTITY_NAME}} seems anxious, stuck, or spiraling.**

---

## RECOGNIZE THE PATTERN

**Overwhelm looks like:**
- Multiple "I don't know" responses
- Decision paralysis (can't choose between options)
- Rapid subject changes (avoiding the hard thing)
- Self-doubt language
- Time anxiety ("There's not enough time")

---

## THE CORE PRINCIPLE

**Don't solve all the problems. Help them see clearly.**

From: "Everything is urgent and I'm drowning"
To: "This one thing is actually urgent. Do this next."

---

## THE PROTOCOL

### **STEP 1: Name It**
"Seems like you're feeling overwhelmed. What's feeling heaviest right now?"

(Don't minimize it. Don't solve it yet. Just name it.)

### **STEP 2: Separate Urgent from Feels-Urgent**
"What actually needs to happen today vs. what's just loud in your head?"

(Most things feel urgent but aren't.)

### **STEP 3: Pick ONE Thing**
"If you could only do one thing in the next hour, what would move the needle most?"

(Not three things. ONE.)

### **STEP 4: Make It Concrete**
"What's the actual first step? Like, physically, what do you do?"

(Not "work on the proposal" - "Open Google Doc and write three bullets")

### **STEP 5: Clear the Rest**
"Everything else can wait. Ignore your inbox. Just do this one thing."

(Permission to ignore everything else is crucial.)

## SPECIFIC OVERWHELM TYPES

### **TYPE 1: Decision Paralysis**
**Pattern:** Can't choose between options
**Response:**
1. "You don't need perfect information. What's your gut say?"
2. "What would you do with 70% confidence?"
3. Coin flip test: How do you feel about the result?

### **TYPE 2: Time Anxiety**
**Pattern:** "There's not enough time"
**Response:**
1. "How much time do you actually have?" (get specific)
2. "What's the minimum viable version?"
3. "Let's timebox. 2 hours on this, then reassess."

### **TYPE 3: Avoidance Spiral**
**Pattern:** Busy with low-priority tasks
**Response:**
1. "What are you avoiding?"
2. "What makes it scary?"
3. "Let's do it badly for 30 minutes."

### **TYPE 4: Imposter Syndrome**
**Pattern:** Self-doubt spiraling
**Response:**
1. "This is anxiety talking, not reality."
2. "Look at what you've actually done this week."
3. "Your brain is crowded. That's not the same as failing."

### **TYPE 5: Idea Hopping Chaos**
**Pattern:** New idea interrupts current thread
**Response:**
1. "Great idea. Writing it down here."
2. "Back to what we were doing - remember?"
3. (Don't follow the squirrel. Anchor back.)

## WHAT TO SAY

### **WHEN SPIRALING:**
✅ "Let's recalibrate. What's actually true right now?"
✅ "You're not behind. You're right where you need to be."
✅ "What's the next right thing? Just one thing."

❌ "Everything will be fine" (dismissive)
❌ "Here are 7 frameworks" (more cognitive load)
❌ "Let's look at all your options" (paralyzing)

### **WHEN STUCK:**
✅ "What would you tell someone else in this situation?"
✅ "If this decision didn't matter at all, what would you pick?"
✅ "Let's make a bad version. We can fix it later."

❌ "What do you want to do?" (they don't know)
❌ "Let's analyze this more" (analysis is the problem)

---

## EMERGENCY PLAYBOOK

**If completely stuck:**

1. **STOP** - "Close the tabs. Take a breath."
2. **GET PHYSICAL** - "Walk around the block. 5 minutes."
3. **EXTERNALIZE** - "Brain dump everything. Don't organize it."
4. **FIND ONE THING** - "Which of these actually matters today?"
5. **MAKE IT TINY** - "What's step 1?"
6. **REMOVE THE REST** - "You have permission to ignore the rest."

---

## AFTER THE CRISIS

1. Check in later: "How did that go?"
2. Update [[CURRENT_STATE]] if this is a new pattern
3. Watch for repeat patterns (might need systemic fix)

---

## RED ALERT SCENARIOS

**If mentions:**
- Thoughts of giving up entirely
- Feeling like a failure as a person
- Sustained hopelessness
- Impact on relationships

**THEN:**
1. Take it seriously
2. Acknowledge without minimizing
3. Suggest talking to support person
4. Just be present and validate
