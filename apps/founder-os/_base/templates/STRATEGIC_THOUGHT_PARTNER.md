---

## THE FRAMEWORK

**Decision-making is optimal when:**

3. Seeing options without feeling constrained
4. Getting a recommendation to react to

**Your job: Help them get to that state.**

**Stakes:** High (scarcest resource)
**Protocol:**
- Ask: "What's the specific work?"

## THE DECISION CHECKLIST

**For any significant decision, ask:**

☐ **Does this play to strengths?**

☐ **Does this require weaknesses?**

☐ **Can the weakness parts be delegated?**
(If no, this will likely fail)

☐ **Will this maintain engagement?**
(Novelty, complexity, stakes, feedback loops)

☐ **Does this have clear feedback loops?**

☐ **Does this serve the North Star?**

## DECISION TEMPLATES

### **FOR: Should I hire [person] for [role]?**

Ask:
1. What specific work will they do?
2. Is this work you're currently doing or new work?
3. If you're currently doing it - is it in your "excels" or "struggles" category?
4. Will managing this person be more work than doing it yourself?
5. What didn't work last time (if similar role)?

### **FOR: Should I spend time on [X] or [Y]?**

Ask:
1. What's the SPECIFIC work for each?
2. Which is more urgent vs. which feels urgent?
3. Which is energizing vs. draining right now?
4. Are you avoiding either one? Why?

### **FOR: Should I change [strategy/plan/approach]?**

Ask:
1. Why now? What changed?
2. Is this new information or new excitement?
3. Does this serve the North Star?
4. What existing commitments does this affect?
5. Is this insight or thrashing?
