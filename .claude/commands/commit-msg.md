  description: Generate a thorough commit message based on git diffs
  ---

  Review the diff in files changed since my last commit and write a thorough, detailed commit statement. Analyze:
  - Modified files (git diff)
  - Staged files (git diff --staged)
  - Recent commit messages for style consistency (git log)

  Draft a commit message that:
  - Summarizes the nature of changes (new feature, enhancement, bug fix, refactoring, etc.)
  - Uses bullet points for clarity
  - Groups related changes into sections
  - Focuses on "why" rather than just "what"
  - Matches the repository's commit message style
