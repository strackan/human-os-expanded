## Overall Design Principles

### Color Palette Recommendations:
- **Primary**: Deep blues/purples (strategic, intelligence)
- **Accent**: Amber/gold (opportunity, growth)
- **Alert**: Red/crimson (risk, urgency)
- **Success**: Emerald green (resolution, renewal)
- **Neutral**: Slate gray (professionalism)

### Typography:
- **Headlines**: Bold, confident sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat Bold, Inter Black)
- **Body**: Clean, readable sans-serif (e.g., Inter Regular, Open Sans)
- **Data/Numbers**: Monospace or tabular numerals for metrics

### Visual Style:
- **Aesthetic**: Modern enterprise SaaS meets thriller/espionage
- **NOT**: Comic book villain, campy evil, dark/gothic
- **YES**: Sleek, strategic, professional with subtle edge
- **References**:
  - James Bond title sequences (sophisticated intrigue)
  - Apple keynote slides (clean, confident)
  - Stripe/Notion product marketing (modern SaaS aesthetic)

### Layout Principles:
- **Whitespace**: Generous (NOT cluttered)

## Transition Concept (Between Slides)

**Slide 1 → Slide 2**: "Meet the customer" → "Understand the stakes"
**Slide 2 → Slide 3**: "The opportunity" → "Why it's hard"
**Slide 3 → Slide 4**: "The challenge" → "The solution"
**Slide 4 → Slide 5**: "The product" → "The experience"

**Narrative Arc**: Hook → Stakes → Challenge → Solution → Journey

## Design Collaboration Notes

### For the Designer:
1. **Villain Theme Execution**:
   - Operation names (e.g., "Operation Blackout") should feel like corporate projects
   - Obsidian Black logo should be sleek/professional (think Umbrella Corp from Resident Evil, but less obvious)
   - Villain designations (e.g., "The Orchestrator") are titles, not costumes

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Health score gauge: Clean, modern (like Stripe's dashboard design)
   - Opportunity value: Financial impact should feel significant but not cartoony
   - Timeline: Strategic roadmap aesthetic (like Gantt charts, but cinematic)

3. **Screenshot Mockups** (Slide 4):
   - You may need to collaborate with FE to export polished UI screenshots
   - Highlight: Risk scores, AI insights, strategic plan artifact
   - Ensure screenshots are high-fidelity (not wireframes)

4. **Iconography**:
   - Use consistent icon set (e.g., Heroicons, Lucide, Phosphor)
   - Icons should reinforce themes: risk (warning), opportunity (growth), engagement (communication)

5. **Animation** (if PowerPoint supports):
   - Slide 1: Health score gauge animates from 10 → 4.2 (decline)
   - Slide 2: Balance scale tips toward risk, then rebalances
   - Slide 3: Timeline reveals challenges sequentially
   - Slide 5: Journey map path draws from left to right
